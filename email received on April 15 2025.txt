Subject: Bemer/Boerner follow-up regarding mortgage

Maria: My client informs me that she deposited one-half of the mortgage payment into the shared account from which PNC pulls the mortgage payment. The payment is due and your client has not paid his half. Please advise this will be completed today. My client is concerned about your client’s lack of response to the bills being due considering he was so aggressive when he wanted to change realtors. The parties have a three-month listing with the realtor your client chose. While the parties wait for the house to be sold, the mortgage must be paid.

 

Please confirm. Carolyn
