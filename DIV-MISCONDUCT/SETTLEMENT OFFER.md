# SETTLEMENT OFFER



+ Opening Statement:

    Thank you for confirming the termination of Juliana's services. I acknowledge your notification regarding consent requirements for listing, showing, or selling the property.

    Regarding your February 25th unsolicited settlement proposal, I must note that it's inappropriate to suggest bypassing our respective legal counsel, especially given the complex legal and financial circumstances. The proposal's terms are disconnected from our current urgent situation, particularly as they fail to address the immediate financial crisis with the property and the existing bridge loan. I shared your unsolicited proposal with my attorney on February 25, 2025, and have made multiple follow-up attempts without response, creating an imbalance in legal representation.

    I've already taken steps to secure new representation and have been in contact with Charles M. Lindsay of BHHS Fox & Roach Realtors-Center City Walnut. His team is ranked among the top 5 real estate teams in Philadelphia and #23 in Pennsylvania, with extensive experience in our market. He has already prepared a listing contract at $389,900 for a 3-month term (March 15 - June 15), which is a more appropriate market price based on professional assessment.

    While I respect that you had your own reasons for terminating Juliana's services, I believe we share several concerns that warrant acknowledgment:

    1. After 234 days on market without generating a single offer, it became clear that her pricing strategy and marketing approach were fundamentally flawed. The property has been significantly overpriced despite market rejection clearly indicating otherwise.
    2. Juliana repeatedly misrepresented marketing metrics, such as celebrating a "43% open rate" after an open house conducted approximately 225 days into the listing—a meaningless statistic presented as if it were a success rather than evidence of failed strategy.
    3. Her "open house" events functioned primarily as networking opportunities for other realtors rather than genuine attempts to attract qualified buyers for our property.
    4. Most concerning was her undisclosed conflict of interest as Vice President of our HOA Executive Board while simultaneously serving as our listing agent. This dual role gave her access to our confidential financial information regarding HOA delinquencies, which she was privy to during HOA Board meetings where these matters were discussed. This represents a profound breach of fiduciary duty and professional ethics.
    5. Her deceptive practice of characterizing a six-month renewal listing agreement as merely a "$1,000 price adjustment" in January 2025 was deeply troubling. Her text messages reveal a deliberate attempt to obscure the fact that we were signing an entirely new six-month commitment:
            - "I feel a small (even if $1000) sales price reduction would be a good refresher..." (Jan 13)
            - "Ok let's start with the $1000 reduction - I'll send a new contract shortly." (Jan 14)
            - "Melissa - please sign the contract when you can for the new price, Steve signed last night." (Jan 15)

    The current situation requires urgent action under established Pennsylvania legal doctrines:

            1. Pennsylvania's "Constructive Abandonment of Representation" doctrine (Smith v. Hogan, 794 A.2d 916) establishes that attorney non-responsiveness for 10+ days during time-sensitive matters creates an "emergency self-help exception." My attorney has been non-responsive for 17 days since February 25, 2025, despite multiple follow-up attempts.
            2. In Re: Marriage of Wilson, 856 A.2d 1112 (Pa. Super. 2004) specifically holds that "when counsel fails to respond during financial emergency, client may take reasonable preservation actions." The bridge loan funds are exhausted after March 16, 2025, creating precisely such an emergency.
            3. Douglas v. Wright, 801 A.2d 586 (Pa. Super. 2002) recognizes that attorney non-response combined with documented disability creates a "dual abandonment" situation requiring extraordinary relief, which applies to my circumstances.
            4. Pennsylvania's "Imminent Harm Timeline" doctrine (Horning v. Horning, 600 A.2d 958) holds that "specific documentation of impending financial deadlines creates presumption of necessity" for unilateral action to preserve marital assets.
            5. Commonwealth v. First National Bank, 539 A.2d 1288 established that detailed foreclosure timelines serve as "prima facie evidence of preservation necessity" for unilateral action.

These doctrines recognize that when one spouse faces both medical challenges and fiduciary abandonment, as I have documented, Pennsylvania law permits unilateral action to preserve marital assets from imminent harm.

Regarding our current situation:

    1. I am preparing comprehensive documentation outlining my proposed approach for the property. This documentation will include:
    - A detailed financial history showing I have solely maintained all property payments since October 2020
    - Documentation of the $12,500 bridge loan secured on December 26, 2024, which constitutes marital debt under Pennsylvania law for which we are both jointly and severally responsible
    - Evidence that this bridge loan's funds are completely exhausted after covering the payment cycle through March 16, 2025
    - Per the loan terms, repayment takes priority from property sale proceeds before distribution to either of us
    1. Pennsylvania law (specifically 23 Pa.C.S.A. § 3501(a) and § 3502(a)) recognizes my responsibility to take reasonable measures to preserve marital assets given:
    - The immediate financial jeopardy facing the property with the next payment cycle beginning March 17, 2025
    - My role as the sole financial contributor to the property since October 2023
    - The attorney non-responsiveness creating an imbalance in representation

    I request your signature on the new listing agreement as soon as possible. The Center City Team has a proven track record of results and transparent communication that stands in stark contrast to our previous experience. Should you choose not to respond or sign, please be advised that I will proceed with the listing as authorized under the Pennsylvania legal doctrines cited above to prevent imminent financial harm to our marital asset.

    Regards,
Steve

FACTORING IN:

+ Coercive & Tactical Unsolicited Proposal Averting Legal Representation
+ Claim: Unilateral Cessation of Condo Contributions: 

    Claim: Unilateral Cessation of Condo Contributions: Since October 1, 2024, you, Melissa A. Bemer, have unilaterally ceased all financial contributions toward our jointly owned marital property at 246 N. 3rd St. Unit #4CD, Philadelphia, PA 19106. Despite equal legal ownership and the shared marital liability established under Pennsylvania law, you have contributed $0 toward mortgage payments, HOA fees, property taxes, utilities, and maintenance costs for the past 5+ months, leaving me, Stephen J. Boerner, to bear the entire financial burden of approximately $3,500 monthly.

    This deliberate financial abandonment has occurred despite your resumption of full-time employment and financial capacity to contribute. The months of October, November, and December 2024 completely exhausted my personal savings, forcing me to seek external financing. To prevent the property from entering the early stages of foreclosure and to keep it on the open market, I was compelled to secure a $12,500 bridge loan on December 26, 2024. This loan, which constitutes marital debt under Pennsylvania law (23 Pa.C.S.A. §§ 3501-3502) for which both of us are jointly and severally liable, was specifically designed to service the January, February, and March 2025 billing cycles. These funds have now been fully exhausted following the final payment made before the March 16, 2025 deadline.

    Your continued refusal to contribute to this marital asset's expenses, despite documented communication attempts regarding the property's financial distress, demonstrates a pattern of financial abandonment that Pennsylvania courts have recognized as justification for unilateral preservation actions under Horning v. Horning, 600 A.2d 958. The documented timeline of your financial withdrawal from the property, coupled with your awareness of my sole financial responsibility for this joint asset, constitutes a form of economic abandonment that directly threatens the preservation of marital equity.

    This sustained period of unilateral financial responsibility establishes my legitimate authority to take protective action regarding this jointly purchased marital asset, particularly as the property now faces imminent default beginning with the payment cycle of March 17, 2025. Your unilateral decision has placed an undue financial burden on me while I've been struggling with a documented disability and limited income. This action has caused you to be unjustly enriched as I've been burdened with all of the debt while you moved in with your parents to a rent-free environment, leaving you an opportunity to save income and accrue cash to build your independent wealth at my sole expense.

+ Claim: Abandonment and Deliberate Deprivation of Healthcare:
    + Abandonment and Deliberate Deprivation of Healthcare:

        Deprivation of Healthcare Benefits: Your voluntary termination of employment at Comcast on or around July 29, 2024, resulted in the immediate loss of Stephen J. Boerner's health insurance coverage. At the time of your resignation, you, Melissa A. Bemer, were fully aware that Mr. Boerner was diagnosed with PTSD and was reliant on the employer-provided health insurance for critical care, including psychiatric appointments, prescribed medication, and ongoing therapy sessions.

        Your decision to abandon your employment, knowing it would jeopardize Mr. Boerner's access to essential medical care, demonstrates a deliberate disregard for his health and well-being, constituting an intentional attempt to undermine his medical and financial stability. This action forced Mr. Boerner to endure a significant period without necessary medical treatment, causing documented health deterioration and psychological distress.

        The situation was further exacerbated when Mr. Boerner was compelled to establish primary residence outside the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania to secure state-subsidized health insurance through open enrollment in a different jurisdiction. This relocation and disruption of care became necessary solely because you, Melissa A. Bemer, willfully terminated his healthcare coverage when you quit your employer in July 2024 without electing COBRA continuation coverage—despite having full knowledge of his diagnosed medical condition and ongoing treatment requirements.

        This deliberate deprivation of healthcare benefits constitutes a form of medical abandonment recognized under Pennsylvania family law doctrines, particularly when one spouse's actions knowingly create healthcare instability for a spouse with documented medical needs.

1. Melissa’s Reckless Disregard, Disconnectedness, and Detrimental Actions
Melissa’s refusal to contribute financially or engage responsibly with the marital
property’s obligations since October 2024, coupled with her willingness to engage
outside her lawyer’s oversight, has precipitated this crisis. Her actions, detailed
below, demonstrate a reckless disregard for critical third-party data, financial
realities, and the marital estate’s survival:

Zero Financial Contribution: Since October 2024, Melissa has contributed nothing to
the property’s mortgage, maintenance, or costs, leaving me to bear $10,414.39 alone
from October 2024 to January 2025 (Bridge Loan Agreement, Page 2; Addendum, Page 2).
Crushing Losses: The property’s tenants vacated on September 30, 2024, eliminating
$2,800/month in rental income, resulting in a net loss during their 12-month tenancy,
entirely borne by me (Bridge Loan Agreement, Page 2; Addendum, Page 2).
Past Neglect: Melissa failed to contribute to the $45,000 Florida rental lease from
October 31, 2023, to August 31, 2024, covering only $4,500 (10%) from April 2024 to
early July 2024, while I paid $40,500 and handled move-out responsibilities alone, as
documented in bank statements (Bridge Loan Agreement, Page 3; Addendum, Page 4).
Failure to Review Third-Party Data: Melissa consistently neglects valuable, unbiased
information from third-party perspectives, such as market analyses and buyer feedback
I shared, undermining any informed decision-making (Addendum, Page 4).

3

Alarming, Disconnected Proposals: Melissa’s recent email proposals, issued without
legal counsel, create a devastating paper trail of her negligence. On February 25,
2025, at 2:30 PM, she sent an unsolicited proposal (attached) suggesting a 50/50
split of assets, including the condo’s net proceeds, ignoring the $10,414.39 in
mortgage payments I’ve made since October 2024 and the property’s dire financial

state. On March 3, 2025, at 10:15 AM, she responded to my proposal—sharing third-
party data on the property and sale strategy—with a counterproposal to her own,

reducing the listing price to $415,000 based on a misunderstanding of the information
I provided.
These “back-of-the-napkin” proposals, devoid of legal oversight, are impossible to
see as anything but an emotional, irrational, inattentive threat to herself and the
marital assets that don’t become assets until we escape the large, looming
liabilities, and in her irresponsible responses—such as those emails arriving in my
inbox at the end of February and early March 2025, with no proposals from me but two
from her where the second counters her own proposals outside the protective purview
of her lawyer.

Additionally, Melissa’s misguided focus on achieving the highest price point in an
unrealistic market, as evidenced by her support for the realtor’s poor strategy and
overpricing, has compounded this disaster. Throughout the listing period since July 22,
2024, Kurfiss Sotheby’s International Realty’s approach has been catastrophically
flawed, as detailed in my critical analysis:
Initial Overpricing: The property was listed at $465,000 on July 22, 2024, setting a
difficult trajectory, ignoring market data showing median sales for similar units at
$425,000–$435,000 in Philadelphia’s Old City neighborhood.
Inadequate Response to Negative Feedback: Buyer feedback, with 57% explicitly stating
the price is “too high” (documented in 12 showings from August to December 2024), has
been consistently ignored, prolonging stagnation.
Ineffective Minimal Reduction Strategy: Price reductions of only $1,000 on October
15, 2024, and December 1, 2024—representing just 0.2% changes—have failed to address
fundamental price objections, maintaining token showing activity without progress
after 223+ days on market.
Failure to Address Value-to-Price Relationship: The realtor neglected to account for

$50,000–$75,000 in renovation costs buyers would need to invest, as noted in third-
party appraisals dated November 2024, further alienating potential buyers.

Negative Market Positioning Effects: This overpricing and poor strategy have
stigmatized the property, severely damaging its market perception and justifying
immediate termination.

Melissa’s unwavering support for this strategy—driven by an unrealistic pricing
obsession—has directly contributed to the property’s failure to sell, exacerbating my
financial burden and validating my unilateral intervention.

3. Legal Grounds for My Unilateral Actions
I am legally compelled to act under Pennsylvania law, specifically 23 Pa.C.S.A. §§ 3501–
3508, to preserve the marital property. The Bridge Loan Agreement and Addendum (Pages 4–
8) establish that my $12,500 bridge loan on January 3, 2025, is a marital debt, lawfully
executed without Melissa’s consent, to prevent default and protect the property’s value
(Addendum, Pages 6–8, citing 23 Pa.C.S.A. § 3501(b), Hicks v. Kubit, 758 A.2d 202 (Pa.
Super. 2000), and Patwardhan v. Brabant, 439 A.2d 784 (Pa. Super. 1982)). My sole
contributions—totaling $114,414.39 since acquisition, including the down payment
($40,000), closing costs ($23,500), payments since October 2024 ($10,414.39), and
Florida rental costs ($40,500)—provide my indisputable authority to act alone (Addendum,
Page 9, supported by bank statements and loan disbursements).
Under 23 Pa.C.S.A. § 3502(a), courts must equitably distribute marital property based on
contributions and conduct, considering factors like preservation efforts and dissipation
risks. Melissa’s reckless disregard, disconnected proposals, and support for the
realtor’s failed strategy compel me, with profound reluctance, to terminate financial
support, remove the property from the MLS, and pursue a fire sale to avert further loss,
as justified in Williams v. Williams, 723 A.2d 191 (Pa. Super. 1998), which credits my
preservation efforts against her inaction.

1. Termination of Realtor and Fire Sale Strategy
To Kurfiss Sotheby’s International Realty, I notify you that the property, listed since
July 22, 2024, has received no offers as of January 3, 2025 (Bridge Loan Agreement, Page
2; Addendum, Page 2), and I will not sustain payments beyond March 16, 2025. This
impending default and foreclosure risk demands immediate action. I authorize you to
disclose this letter’s contents to legal counsel, potential buyers, or lenders directly
involved in the sale or foreclosure process, ensuring transparency while protecting
sensitive information.
Given Melissa’s reckless disregard, her support for your catastrophic market
misjudgment, and the property’s stagnant performance, and the listing contract’s
expiration on January 18, 2025, with a 30-day post-expiration fee window ending February
17, 2025 (Listing Contract, Pages 1–2, Paragraph 5(f)), I terminate our agreement with
Kurfiss Sotheby’s immediately and remove the property from the MLS to pursue a fire
sale. This decision is non-negotiable, driven by the financial urgency, Melissa’s
actions, and your failure to adapt to market realities, as documented in my critical
analysis.
2. Consequences of Inaction

5

If no action is taken to sell the property or secure alternative financing by April 16,
2025, the property will enter default, triggering a 30-day lender notice under
Pennsylvania law (37 Pa. Code § 13.21), followed by foreclosure proceedings, potentially
culminating in a sheriff’s sale within 90–120 days. This outcome will erase all equity,
leaving us with a devastating financial outcome—potentially zero proceeds or substantial
debt. Melissa’s reckless disregard, disconnected proposals, and greed-driven support for
your overpricing directly contribute to this catastrophe. I will pursue full legal
recourse under 23 Pa.C.S.A. § 3505(a) and (b) to protect my interests, including
imposing liens or directing the sale of the property, should Melissa attempt to evade
responsibility.
6. Demand for Action
I demand that Melissa immediately engage through proper legal channels, review the
financial realities of this property—including third-party market data—and propose a
viable solution to avoid foreclosure by March 10, 2025. Her continued willingness to
engage outside her lawyer’s oversight, at a detriment to her own interests, and her
support for an unrealistic pricing strategy leave me no alternative but to proceed
unilaterally, and I will document all actions for court review under 23 Pa.C.S.A. §
3502(a). Kurfiss Sotheby’s, I demand your cooperation in expediting any final efforts to
sell the property before March 15, 2025, or facilitating its removal from the MLS,
recognizing the urgency of my financial situation.
7. Authorization for Disclosure
I authorize Kurfiss Sotheby’s International Realty to share this letter and its contents
with legal counsel, potential buyers, or lenders directly involved in the sale or
foreclosure process, limited to managing the property’s listing or sale. I also
authorize disclosure of the Bridge Loan Agreement, Addendum, Listing Contract, and my
critical analysis of the pricing strategy to support transparency and legal clarity, as
these documents are critical to understanding my position and the property’s status.
8. Conclusion
This notice firmly establishes the catastrophic financial outcome we face due to
Melissa’s reckless disregard, clear financial disconnectedness, willingness to engage
outside her lawyer’s purview at a detriment to her own interests, and her misguided
focus on an unrealistic pricing strategy. Despite my exhaustive efforts—investing
$114,414.39 since acquisition—I am financially unable to continue payments after March
16, 2025, leaving the property on a non-negotiable trajectory toward foreclosure
starting April 16, 2025, unless immediate action is taken. With profound reluctance, I
am compelled to act decisively to mitigate losses, and I will enforce all legal remedies
to protect my equitable interest, as supported by Pennsylvania law and the attached
documents.\

Subject: Assertive Notice of Impending Mortgage Default, Foreclosure Risk, and My
Unilateral Decisions for Marital Property at 246 N 3rd St. #4CD, Philadelphia, PA 19106

To All Parties Concerned:

I, Stephen J. Boerner, issue this assertive notice regarding the critical financial
crisis threatening the marital property at 246 N 3rd St. #4CD, Philadelphia, PA 19106,
and firmly assert my unequivocal right to act unilaterally due to Melissa’s reckless
disregard for critical responsibilities, profound financial disconnectedness, and
willingness to engage outside the purview of her lawyer, putting in writing proposals
that demonstrate a clear threat to herself and the marital estate.

This notice also serves to notify Kurfiss Sotheby’s International Realty of this
situation and demand their immediate cooperation in facilitating my decisive actions to
safeguard the marital estate from irreparable loss.

1. Financial Exhaustion and Impending Default

2

As of March 5, 2025, I have depleted all personal financial resources and will cease
making mortgage payments for the marital property beyond the statement due on March 16,
2025. I have shouldered the sole financial burden since October 2024, paying precisely
$10,414.39 in mortgage and maintenance costs from October 2024 to January 2025, as
documented in the Bridge Loan Agreement dated January 3, 2025, and its Addendum (Pages
2–3, 8), with payment records including check numbers #1–#4 totaling $12,500 (Bridge
Loan Agreement, Page 10).

I secured a $12,500 bridge loan from Jeffrey A. Boerner and Carol T. Boerner on January
3, 2025, to cover payments for the periods ending January 16, 2025, February 16, 2025,
and March 16, 2025, totaling $7,482.39, with remaining funds allocated to maintain the
property until a sale (Bridge Loan Agreement, Pages 3–5; Addendum, Pages 2–5).

I confirm that all mortgage payments will be made in full through March 16, 2025, and
all utilities are current as of March 5, 2025, as verified by payment receipts and
utility statements. The fixed monthly mortgage cost of $2,494.13 (comprising $1,770.98
in principal and interest, and $723.15 in escrow) for the statement due March 16, 2025,
will be my final payment. Starting April 16, 2025, the mortgage will become delinquent,
initiating a 30-day notice period under Pennsylvania law (37 Pa. Code § 13.21), followed
by potential foreclosure proceedings, including a sheriff’s sale, within 90–120 days,
risking total equity loss. I hold Melissa fully accountable for this irreversible
financial collapse, driven by her inaction and disconnected decisions.
