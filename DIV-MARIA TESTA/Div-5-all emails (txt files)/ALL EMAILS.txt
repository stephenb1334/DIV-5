Unfortunately, Maria’s schedule is so hectic this week between court and conferences. I do have some availability next week if you’d like!
 
We have:

Do any of those times work for you?

Hi Steve:
 
Unfortunately, Maria’s schedule is so hectic this week between court and conferences. I do have some availability next week if you’d like! 
 
We have: 
 
Monday (2/10) at 2pm
Tuesday (2/11) at 9am, 10am, or 12pm
 
Do any of those times work for you?

Hi:
 
I just looked through what you created and I am wondering if you can call me. (610) 239-1000. Since our disclosure is technically past deadline, we will want to provide this promptly and want to ensure we are only providing what you approve. 
 
Thank you,
Randi

I hope you are well. 
 
I just checked the link, and see you have not uploaded anything.  When we spoke, I had told you that 12.30.24 was the date we agreed to exchange.  Are you planning on uploading the documents today?

Assuming you mean next Wednesday, the 18th. 1pm works on the 18th. Are you calling me? That is my preference. Calling from 267-312-1810? Just in case you call from your office line, I may ignore it; I get so much spam from 267, 215, and 610, and I have an app that filters out calls, so I don’t even see them. I have your cell saved, so it will come through.
 
As for the answer to the response, I guess I don’t see why it took that long to just refuse everything. It's been about 2 months? We can discuss it next week. Please confirm the calling day and time. I have it on my calendar; no need for an invite. I may ignore calls since I get so much spam from 267, 215, and 610, and I have an app that filters out calls, so I don't even see them.

Hi Maria and Randi, checking if you received the below 6 days back. I’d like to set up a call for early to mid next week if possible. By then we should have Melissa’s financials as this Friday was her deadline. Correct me if I’m wrong. I would like to present the terms of our positioning from my side of the family more clearly. I’m flexible please feel free to pick a 20-30 minute time slot that works for you.

To be blunt,  I know she’s starting from zero and to be even more blunt… I know she’s working because she reactivated her nursing license on September 3, 2024 per the public records I can see
 
 I don’t have any real interest in seeking alimony or any financial gain unless you can point a specific dollars or strategy I am emotionally leaving on the table, which I am rationally open to hearing about.
 
And to be even more blunt she basically told me in so many wordsto go F myself in the one instance, I softly brought up the concept of sharing in Expenses that we carry forward together, …
 
(especially the Mortgage for the Philadelphia condo property we bought during our marriage that has been on the market for 140 days. Add further this property is now on month three of mortgage owed without tenants to offset - so I have been paying all the utilities and mortgage, HOA dues of $750/month, etc on my own )
 
Ive also had multiple financial blows since we last spoke (Our landlord from Florida was supposed to return a $4500 security deposit, but has broken every rule in the book deciding to keep it for himself so I am now suing him and going out of pocket with massive effort and cost - and not to go on and on but belongings I left at a friend’s house in Florida such as a $6000 golf cart that was for sale was all swept away by the hurricanes after I left roughly $12,000 worth of belongings )
 
And since I didn’t have my car because she took it, the cost of moving my belongings and renting a sizable enough vehicle to get it all the way back up north was very costly
 
I sold off all of my cryptocurrency (her lawyer’s email specify this because Melissa knows how important that was to me, but it is all gone), along with having sold physical metals
 
and outside of a sheepish 401(k) and some private shares I bought as an accredited investor several years ago (that I very much do not want to let go of pre-IPO) there isn’t much to put on paper for her to take
 
And a jeep grand Cherokee I bought before our marriage started so I think that technically won’t count towards the pie)
 
That all said, I am down to dollars and cents, but remain debt free minus the mortgage. 
 
I haven’t pursued a W-2 income in fear. I would jeopardize her taking a portion of that and I’m staying with my parents in Rock Hall , Maryland. 
 
My parents, where is I call them humbly “my  roommates” have come to the table (along with one other investor) and pitched me the idea of buying out Melissa from the currently for sale condo property we own in Philadelphia that continues to have lackluster showings and drop after drop in price. 
 
The offer we came up with is a flat $20,000. 
 
If we couple that offer with showing enough of my financials to illustrate the above details and we show that I’ve paid 95% of all costs from the initial down payment and closing cost all the way through to the recurring bills she doesn’t even think of let alone pay Then I could whittle her 50% equity amount down to a number below 20,000. 
 
Our principle is $347,000 give or take and the purchase price was 400,000 so the equity is not high assuming an appraisal would come in around 400 which I’m confident it would even though it’s listed at 435,000 currently. 
 
If Pennsylvania starts us at 50% equally in terms of equity but allows consideration for who paid what after the fact and considering she’s not paying the $3300 per month of fixed mortgage plus HOA dues plus utilities to keep the lights on that I am paying on our mutual behalf then $20,000 should look good. 
 
We want to form an LLC and retain the property and the two private parking spots on an adjacent property that are likely worth more than the condo itself assuming the lot sells like many of the neighboring lots have sold in old city. 
 
I’ll spare you the strategy but we would transfer the title from Melissa and myself to an LLC with my two parents and one other investor plus myself so we would have to afford the transfer fees of $9000 or so but everyone has agreed
 
Instead of spending the time of fruitlessly uploading documents for the sake of uploading documents, I thought I would put this idea here for you to ruminate and guide me on providing the most value towards this proposal without spinning my wheels on efforts that would go wasted otherwise

Maria, I have yet to turn in my financials to you but we are yet to receive Melissa’s correct?
 
I ask because my parents and I have aligned on a buyout proposal. We can couple it with the financial snapshot to justify the buyout proposal and ultimately a proposal to conclude the marriage formally without any more delay. 
 
What is the best method to move forward and introduce you to the details of the condo buyout.

Hi, 
 
I don’t see any issue with this proposal at all.  But, typically, when making a settlement proposal it is for a global settlement and not piecemeal.  
 
I am happy to let them know you would like to buy her out of the condo, but they are likely not going to agree unless and until we settle everything.  There are bank accounts, retirement accounts, crypto accounts, and the Jeep, etc.

Error! Filename not specified.
Maria, 
 
After discussing with my family, we’re interested in exploring the possibility of buying out Melissa’s share of the Philadelphia condo we purchased during our marriage. I’d like your input on whether it would be appropriate for you to make an offer on my behalf to her lawyer and, ultimately, to Melissa.
 
Our goal in pursuing this route is to streamline the process, avoid the complexities of discovery, and step away from any contentious stances, including potential alimony disputes. If there is resistance or we anticipate any, I believe additional discovery into the condo’s funding could demonstrate that I covered 99 percent of the expenses, potentially impacting her entitlement to a full 50 percent of the current equity.
 
Should we move forward, we’d need a proper appraisal and extend her the opportunity to get an independent appraisal as well, establishing the current equity. 
 
Additionally, I plan to create an LLC specifically for the purpose of transferring ownership. I’m aware that transfer taxes in Philadelphia are significant, but I have compelling reasons to retain ownership, which I’d be happy to discuss during a brief call. Also, to avoid taxes elsewhere this would be completely at the start of the new year but preferably offered and potentially agreed upon sooner than later so we could remove the condo from the for sale market 
 
I’m available at any time this week, so please let me know a convenient time for us to talk, or feel free to call me directly.

If we couple that offer with showing enough of my financials to illustrate the above details and we show that I’ve paid 95% of all costs from the initial down payment and closing cost all the way through to the recurring bills she doesn’t even think of let alone pay Then I could whittle her 50% equity amount down to a number below 20,000. 
 
Our principle is $347,000 give or take and the purchase price was 400,000 so the equity is not high assuming an appraisal would come in around 400 which I’m confident it would even though it’s listed at 435,000 currently. 
 
If Pennsylvania starts us at 50% equally in terms of equity but allows consideration for who paid what after the fact and considering she’s not paying the $3300 per month of fixed mortgage plus HOA dues plus utilities to keep the lights on that I am paying on our mutual behalf then $20,000 should look good. 
 
We want to form an LLC and retain the property and the two private parking spots on an adjacent property that are likely worth more than the condo itself assuming the lot sells like many of the neighboring lots have sold in old city. 
 
I’ll spare you the strategy but we would transfer the title from Melissa and myself to an LLC with my two parents and one other investor plus myself so we would have to afford the transfer fees of $9000 or so but everyone has agreed
 
Instead of spending the time of fruitlessly uploading documents for the sake of uploading documents, I thought I would put this idea here for you to ruminate and guide me on providing the most value towards this proposal without spinning my wheels on efforts that would go wasted otherwise

Maria, I have yet to turn in my financials to you but we are yet to receive Melissa’s correct?
 
I ask because my parents and I have aligned on a buyout proposal. We can couple it with the financial snapshot to justify the buyout proposal and ultimately a proposal to conclude the marriage formally without any more delay.

I don’t see any issue with this proposal at all.  But, typically, when making a settlement proposal it is for a global settlement and not piecemeal.

Error! Filename not specified.
Maria, 
 
After discussing with my family, we’re interested in exploring the possibility of buying out Melissa’s share of the Philadelphia condo we purchased during our marriage. I’d like your input on whether it would be appropriate for you to make an offer on my behalf to her lawyer and, ultimately, to Melissa.
 
Our goal in pursuing this route is to streamline the process, avoid the complexities of discovery, and step away from any contentious stances, including potential alimony disputes. If there is resistance or we anticipate any, I believe additional discovery into the condo’s funding could demonstrate that I covered 99 percent of the expenses, potentially impacting her entitlement to a full 50 percent of the current equity.
 
Should we move forward, we’d need a proper appraisal and extend her the opportunity to get an independent appraisal as well, establishing the current equity. 
 
Additionally, I plan to create an LLC specifically for the purpose of transferring ownership. I’m aware that transfer taxes in Philadelphia are significant, but I have compelling reasons to retain ownership, which I’d be happy to discuss during a brief call. Also, to avoid taxes elsewhere this would be completely at the start of the new year but preferably offered and potentially agreed upon sooner than later so we could remove the condo from the for sale market 
 
I’m available at any time this week, so please let me know a convenient time for us to talk, or feel free to call me directly.

Assuming you mean next Wednesday, the 18th. 1pm works on the 18th. Are you calling me? That is my preference. Calling from 267-312-1810? Just in case you call from your office line, I may ignore it; I get so much spam from 267, 215, and 610, and I have an app that filters out calls, so I don’t even see them. I have your cell saved, so it will come through.

As for the answer to the response, I guess I don’t see why it took that long to just refuse everything. It's been about 2 months? We can discuss it next week. Please confirm the calling day and time. I have it on my calendar; no need for an invite. I may ignore calls since I get so much spam from 267, 215, and 610, and I have an app that filters out calls, so I don't even see them.

Hi Maria and Randi, checking if you received the below 6 days back. I’d like to set up a call for early to mid next week if possible. By then we should have Melissa’s financials as this Friday was her deadline. Correct me if I’m wrong. I would like to present the terms of our positioning from my side of the family more clearly. I’m flexible please feel free to pick a 20-30 minute time slot that works for you.

(especially the Mortgage for the Philadelphia condo property we bought during our marriage that has been on the market for 140 days. Add further this property is now on month three of mortgage owed without tenants to offset - so I have been paying all the utilities and mortgage, HOA dues of $750/month, etc on my own )

Ive also had multiple financial blows since we last spoke (Our landlord from Florida was supposed to return a $4500 security deposit, but has broken every rule in the book deciding to keep it for himself so I am now suing him and going out of pocket with massive effort and cost - and not to go on and on but belongings I left at a friend’s house in Florida such as a $6000 golf cart that was for sale was all swept away by the hurricanes after I left roughly $12,000 worth of belongings )

And since I didn’t have my car because she took it, the cost of moving my belongings and renting a sizable enough vehicle to get it all the way back up north was very costly

I sold off all of my cryptocurrency (her lawyer’s email specify this because Melissa knows how important that was to me, but it is all gone), along with having sold physical metals

and outside of a sheepish 401(k) and some private shares I bought as an accredited investor several years ago (that I very much do not want to let go of pre-IPO) there isn’t much to put on paper for her to take

And a jeep grand Cherokee I bought before our marriage started so I think that technically won’t count towards the pie)

That all said, I am down to dollars and cents, but remain debt free minus the mortgage. 

I haven’t pursued a W-2 income in fear. I would jeopardize her taking a portion of that and I’m staying with my parents in Rock Hall , Maryland. 

My parents, where is I call them humbly “my  roommates” have come to the table (along with one other investor) and pitched me the idea of buying out Melissa from the currently for sale condo property we own in Philadelphia that continues to have lackluster showings and drop after drop in price. 

The offer we came up with is a flat $20,000. 

If we couple that offer with showing enough of my financials to illustrate the above details and we show that I’ve paid 95% of all costs from the initial down payment and closing cost all the way through to the recurring bills she doesn’t even think of let alone pay Then I could whittle her 50% equity amount down to a number below 20,000. 

Our principle is $347,000 give or take and the purchase price was 400,000 so the equity is not high assuming an appraisal would come in around 400 which I’m confident it would even though it’s listed at 435,000 currently. 

If Pennsylvania starts us at 50% equally in terms of equity but allows consideration for who paid what after the fact and considering she’s not paying the $3300 per month of fixed mortgage plus HOA dues plus utilities to keep the lights on that I am paying on our mutual behalf then $20,000 should look good. 

We want to form an LLC and retain the property and the two private parking spots on an adjacent property that are likely worth more than the condo itself assuming the lot sells like many of the neighboring lots have sold in old city. 

I’ll spare you the strategy but we would transfer the title from Melissa and myself to an LLC with my two parents and one other investor plus myself so we would have to afford the transfer fees of $9000 or so but everyone has agreed

Instead of spending the time of fruitlessly uploading documents for the sake of uploading documents, I thought I would put this idea here for you to ruminate and guide me on providing the most value towards this proposal without spinning my wheels on efforts that would go wasted otherwise

Error! Filename not specified.
Maria, 
 
After discussing with my family, we’re interested in exploring the possibility of buying out Melissa’s share of the Philadelphia condo we purchased during our marriage. I’d like your input on whether it would be appropriate for you to make an offer on my behalf to her lawyer and, ultimately, to Melissa.
 
Our goal in pursuing this route is to streamline the process, avoid the complexities of discovery, and step away from any contentious stances, including potential alimony disputes. If there is resistance or we anticipate any, I believe additional discovery into the condo’s funding could demonstrate that I covered 99 percent of the expenses, potentially impacting her entitlement to a full 50 percent of the current equity.
 
Should we move forward, we’d need a proper appraisal and extend her the opportunity to get an independent appraisal as well, establishing the current equity. 
 
Additionally, I plan to create an LLC specifically for the purpose of transferring ownership. I’m aware that transfer taxes in Philadelphia are significant, but I have compelling reasons to retain ownership, which I’d be happy to discuss during a brief call. Also, to avoid taxes elsewhere this would be completely at the start of the new year but preferably offered and potentially agreed upon sooner than later so we could remove the condo from the for sale market 
 
I’m available at any time this week, so please let me know a convenient time for us to talk, or feel free to call me directly.

Maria: I will address issues you raised in your email to me and reserve my client’s right to argue your client has dissipated the marital estate in the divorce. 
With respect to the condo, my client has met with the realtor and has signed the listing agreement. It my understanding the condo is now listed for sale. Please note, my client is reserving the right to argue the listing price is below market value but she is aware the parties need to get the condo sold. There remains outstanding HOA fees in excess of $3,500 which your client has not paid. My client will be paying $1,000 towards the fees and she is asking that your client to also pay $1000 towards the outstanding fees.  Additionally, for the next three months the parties shall equally divide the costs of the HOA fees moving forward. 
With respect to the mortgage, my client is willing to equally divide this expense as well for the next three months. If the house does not sell in the next three months the parties will have to reassess payment of the costs.
Finally, please have your client provide a full accounting of the cryptocurrency account he depleted. I previously requested this information in discovery and have not received a response. Please also confirm your client will pay his share of the obligations for the next three months. Thank you ~ Carolyn

 EXTERNAL EMAIL  
Hello,
 
Unfortunately, your client has given you information based on inaccuracies and half-truths. 
 
For clarification, your client was aware of the Realtor situation; as there have been a series of issues with this individual, including her failure to disclose to the parties’ and the condo board that she, herself, is a not only a resident in the building, but the Vice President of the Homeowners’ Association. Knowing the parties’ situation as the acting listing/seller’s agent, she continued to issue demands in her capacity as an Association board member for past due association fees and dues, including threatening legal action. Additionally, the property sat active for over 200 days without a single offer. An obvious indication the listing was outrageously overpriced. Due to the various issues, leaving my client distrusting of this individual to represent either party’s best interest, he discussed with your client the intention to disengage with this person. You stated yourself that your client received “multiple emails” so, it can be assumed that this change is not a shock to her. In fact, your client is in sole operation of the email account directly associated with the condo and its management.  
 
Your client continues to take what she can from Mr. Boerner with no intention of reaching resolution. Her so-called proposals are insulting to my client and his current situation. Again, I must waste time correcting your client’s representations to you regarding my client “living” at the property. My client has spent a total of 8 nights at the property since it’s vacancy in October 2024. Of those 8 nights, 2 of them were for his own reasoning; with the remainder being for various needs, repairs, service visits, and general upkeep of the property. Your client has been aware since late September 2024 that my client’s resources were quickly depleting and by March 2025, he would no longer have the resources to financially maintain the property. 
 
Each day your client refuses to sign the listing agreement is another day the condo remains off market.  
 
Given the above and the current market temperature, I would expect this issue will be resolved very soon. 
 
Thank you.

Maria: I am sending you one of many emails my client has received regarding the sale of the condo. As a result of the emails and actions of your client the Relator is no longer the listing agent and your client has unilaterally secured a new Realtor and wants the condo price reduced significantly. He also says he is no longer paying the mortgage beginning this month even though your client has been living at the condo. Please let me know if you are free to speak today to discuss this issue.

Please let me know if you held the call with Melissa’s lawyer. I’m not here to tell you what to do in your job, but all I ask is you are aggressive and strong. I believe we hold the advantage and I believe Melissa is scared, resorting to lies. Melissa took the stance that she would not be paying anything towards the $3,500 fixed costs monthly and she made that stance in since September 2024. Only NOW is she claiming she has no responsibility for that monthly tab bc she claims I “have been living there.” This lawyer is getting fed lies fabrications that are baseless and this lawyer is coming to your door step with undocumented, unprovable information. That is Melissa’s favorite information, baseless information. I want full attack mode, I want to leverage my disability to the maximum, and I want to point to financial misconduct, medical abandonment, a history of marital related abandonment I could fill a book with my documentation, and financial ineptitude so greedy she became a liability and incapable of being a sound mind in the dealings of this property we own together. Unilateral decisions she’s made aren’t warranted. But the single act I was forced to take in replacing a dirty realtor and correcting a misguiding pricing strategy was required to save and protect the marital property. I also took a bridge loan and it’s written as a personal obligation non collateralized to ensure it falls under marital debt. This was for $12,500 for float the property costs January , February, and March. Now exhausted.

Since October 1, 2024, I have spent eight nights at the condo during its vacancy. Two of those nights were when the Philadelphia Eagles won the Super Bowl. And six of those nights were based out of necessity such as the last three nights in which I have been here strictly to service the needs of the marital property. I’ve been meeting with real estate investors, advisors, real estate attorneys, I’ve taken the pictures that will serve as the new listings 31 photos that were removed when I fired the realtor who didn’t get a single offer for 234 days and systematically overpriced our condo. The same Realtor I fired held Multiple conflicts of interest, none of which were disclosed, which is a major breach under the national association of realtors in a violation of both her code of ethics and professional Standards that realtors are held to. First of all, she lives in the same building. Second of all this Realtor serves as the vice president of the homeowners association. 
 
On one hand, she was issuing demands for past due homeowners association, dues and threatening, legal action, and on the other hand, she was our sellers agent. This is the same sellers agent took advantage of her clients being divorced and uncommunicative as she disguised a Six month renewal contract as a $1000 price decrease. This is all documented in how she executed sleight-of-hand to a couple that was vulnerable and expecting the thousand dollar price decrease signing documents, but was served at renewal without disclosure or transparency. 
 
 This realtor has been reported to the board and it is known that she failed to issue a conflict of interest statement to the board as well. In overseeing the marital estate, it becomes an obligation to remove her from the point person Whom we trust to sell our condo. 
 
I had third-party hired data And individual advisors Appraise the pricing and strategy of our former realtor and in the process of sharing that data with Melissa was met with a ineptitude and unwillingness to review the information. All the data came back supporting systematic over pricing.
 
Melissa has only been greedy about decision-making related to the properties listing price. It became apparent to me she was inept, incapable, and unwilling to participate in proper appraisal of the information I started to share with her .
 
I cited State doctrine that supports me. There is financial misconduct at play and there is my Disability…
 
And Maria,
 
Drive into this lawyers skull A few key things: 
 
- Her client has sent me three unsolicited proposals in 2025 - one of which with a timeline ultimatum they caused me undue harm and mental distress- Melissa’s proposed strategy is to circumvent lawyers as she put in writing
 
- Melissa’s proposals are so disconnected, Irrational and uneducated Throwing out proposed terms that would be detrimental to her own financial well-being- The words use in these emails are extremely elementary and so concerning that acting on them would be unethical
 
^^^ Proposing such terms, In the form of unsolicited proposals sent via email with the intent to Circumvent legal and then to pressure me with a time based ultimatum is extremely inappropriate and I let that be known 
 
 
^^^ please also note that I sent you the first proposal on February 25, 2025. For the sake of getting your information to issue a response, I won’t address The lack of response to review the proposal and also my request in that same email February 25 to your assistant to a meeting for the first available opening in your schedule. I need a lawyer to catch up and act and then we will discuss
 
Continuing…
 
- her client Deepens her track record of unilateral decision-making - late September 2024, which was Pre-October 1st 2024, (The day 1 that our condo became vacant from tenants offsetting a monthly fixed cost of $3500 required to service the condo)
 
I emailed Melissa in late September 2024 to remind her of this upcoming Obligation 
 
Melissa replied to my email In late September 2024. I can paraphrase her response as: “Go fuck yourself.” 
Although she use different words, she let it be known that her unilateral decision was to abandon financial obligation. 
 
Since, She has remained 100% disassociated with all costs while remaining very engaged in the activities around selling the property and her perceived proceeds to come from it. 
 
She further blocked me from a shared Gmail account we established in our marriage. Another example of an Another example of unilateral decision-making unilateral decision-making. 
 
Much of the admin for the condo’s cost obligation was managed through that email address. I have documented eight requests that I issued to her Since separation - essentially me pleading for her to share in the access that she restricted. 
 
Even while working on financial disclosure documentation, I wrote to Melissa and told her that to help my ability to provide a thorough financial disclosure having access to that email address was imperative because that email address is the username and associated email to multiple accounts that I manage related to the condominium. Even with that reasoning, she declined To share access and only out of spite. Melissa has served as a bump on a log that shifts and positions itself in unreasonable and unpredictable ways. I had no choice but to act independently and Pennsylvania State doctrine is clear and what it supports.
 
To go back further regarding unilateral decision-making. I was diagnosed with a disability related to my mental health in June 2024. In July 2024, Melissa voluntarily quit her job without telling me and I began August 2024 without the medical care that took months to set up. I was not even informed by Melissa herself. It took me asking Melissa the status of her employment for her to tell me that she quit at the end of July and benefits were lost on the last day of the month that she quit. 
 
So: 
 
1) Financial misconduct
 
2) Medical abandonment
 
3) Complete lie about me living at the condo - I have spent eight nights here since October 1, 2024, when the condo became vacant and the tenants left 
 
 
two nights were spent here for pleasure and six nights on necessity such as the last several nights as I wake up every day, servicing the property meeting with realtors and exploring creative ways to solve the issue related to our unsold Condo
 
.0119 % of the days since October 1, 2024 I have stayed at the condo based on non-necessity that being two nights out of 168 possible nights
 
 
.0357 % of the day since October 1, 2024 I have stayed at the condo based purely on the necessity to be here for Service repairs cleaners meeting with realtors showing the condo to real estate investors that being six nights out of of 168 possible nights

Maria: I am sending you one of many emails my client has received regarding the sale of the condo. As a result of the emails and actions of your client the Relator is no longer the listing agent and your client has unilaterally secured a new Realtor and wants the condo price reduced significantly. He also says he is no longer paying the mortgage beginning this month even though your client has been living at the condo. Please let me know if you are free to speak today to discuss this issue.

Please let me know if you held the call with Melissa’s lawyer. I’m not here to tell you what to do in your job, but all I ask is you are aggressive and strong. I believe we hold the advantage and I believe Melissa is scared, resorting to lies. Melissa took the stance that she would not be paying anything towards the $3,500 fixed costs monthly and she made that stance in since September 2024. Only NOW is she claiming she has no responsibility for that monthly tab bc she claims I “have been living there.” This lawyer is getting fed lies fabrications that are baseless and this lawyer is coming to your door step with undocumented, unprovable information. That is Melissa’s favorite information, baseless information. I want full attack mode, I want to leverage my disability to the maximum, and I want to point to financial misconduct, medical abandonment, a history of marital related abandonment I could fill a book with my documentation, and financial ineptitude so greedy she became a liability and incapable of being a sound mind in the dealings of this property we own together. Unilateral decisions she’s made aren’t warranted. But the single act I was forced to take in replacing a dirty realtor and correcting a misguiding pricing strategy was required to save and protect the marital property. I also took a bridge loan and it’s written as a personal obligation non collateralized to ensure it falls under marital debt. This was for $12,500 for float the property costs January , February, and March. Now exhausted.

Hello,
 
Unfortunately, your client has given you information based on inaccuracies and half-truths. 
 
For clarification, your client was aware of the Realtor situation; as there have been a series of issues with this individual, including her failure to disclose to the parties’ and the condo board that she, herself, is a not only a resident in the building, but the Vice President of the Homeowners’ Association. Knowing the parties’ situation as the acting listing/seller’s agent, she continued to issue demands in her capacity as an Association board member for past due association fees and dues, including threatening legal action. Additionally, the property sat active for over 200 days without a single offer. An obvious indication the listing was outrageously overpriced. Due to the various issues, leaving my client distrusting of this individual to represent either party’s best interest, he discussed with your client the intention to disengage with this person. You stated yourself that your client received “multiple emails” so, it can be assumed that this change is not a shock to her. In fact, your client is in sole operation of the email account directly associated with the condo and its management.  
 
Your client continues to take what she can from Mr. Boerner with no intention of reaching resolution. Her so-called proposals are insulting to my client and his current situation. Again, I must waste time correcting your client’s representations to you regarding my client “living” at the property. My client has spent a total of 8 nights at the property since it’s vacancy in October 2024. Of those 8 nights, 2 of them were for his own reasoning; with the remainder being for various needs, repairs, service visits, and general upkeep of the property. Your client has been aware since late September 2024 that my client’s resources were quickly depleting and by March 2025, he would no longer have the resources to financially maintain the property. 
 
Each day your client refuses to sign the listing agreement is another day the condo remains off market.  
 
Given the above and the current market temperature, I would expect this issue will be resolved very soon. 
 
Thank you.

Randi, 

When will the letter be issued? Every day Melissa isn’t signing the listing agreement is a day the condo is off the market. This is awful on Melissa’s part to delay this

Please let me know if you held the call with Melissa’s lawyer. I’m not here to tell you what to do in your job, but all I ask is you are aggressive and strong. I believe we hold the advantage and I believe Melissa is scared, resorting to lies. Melissa took the stance that she would not be paying anything towards the $3,500 fixed costs monthly and she made that stance in since September 2024. Only NOW is she claiming she has no responsibility for that monthly tab bc she claims I “have been living there.” This lawyer is getting fed lies fabrications that are baseless and this lawyer is coming to your door step with undocumented, unprovable information. That is Melissa’s favorite information, baseless information. I want full attack mode, I want to leverage my disability to the maximum, and I want to point to financial misconduct, medical abandonment, a history of marital related abandonment I could fill a book with my documentation, and financial ineptitude so greedy she became a liability and incapable of being a sound mind in the dealings of this property we own together. Unilateral decisions she’s made aren’t warranted. But the single act I was forced to take in replacing a dirty realtor and correcting a misguiding pricing strategy was required to save and protect the marital property. I also took a bridge loan and it’s written as a personal obligation non collateralized to ensure it falls under marital debt. This was for $12,500 for float the property costs January , February, and March. Now exhausted.

Since October 1, 2024, I have spent eight nights at the condo during its vacancy. Two of those nights were when the Philadelphia Eagles won the Super Bowl. And six of those nights were based out of necessity such as the last three nights in which I have been here strictly to service the needs of the marital property. I’ve been meeting with real estate investors, advisors, real estate attorneys, I’ve taken the pictures that will serve as the new listings 31 photos that were removed when I fired the realtor who didn’t get a single offer for 234 days and systematically overpriced our condo. The same Realtor I fired held Multiple conflicts of interest, none of which were disclosed, which is a major breach under the national association of realtors in a violation of both her code of ethics and professional Standards that realtors are held to. First of all, she lives in the same building. Second of all this Realtor serves as the vice president of the homeowners association. 
 
On one hand, she was issuing demands for past due homeowners association, dues and threatening, legal action, and on the other hand, she was our sellers agent. This is the same sellers agent took advantage of her clients being divorced and uncommunicative as she disguised a Six month renewal contract as a $1000 price decrease. This is all documented in how she executed sleight-of-hand to a couple that was vulnerable and expecting the thousand dollar price decrease signing documents, but was served at renewal without disclosure or transparency. 
 
 This realtor has been reported to the board and it is known that she failed to issue a conflict of interest statement to the board as well. In overseeing the marital estate, it becomes an obligation to remove her from the point person Whom we trust to sell our condo. 
 
I had third-party hired data And individual advisors Appraise the pricing and strategy of our former realtor and in the process of sharing that data with Melissa was met with a ineptitude and unwillingness to review the information. All the data came back supporting systematic over pricing.
 
Melissa has only been greedy about decision-making related to the properties listing price. It became apparent to me she was inept, incapable, and unwilling to participate in proper appraisal of the information I started to share with her .
 
I cited State doctrine that supports me. There is financial misconduct at play and there is my Disability…
 
And Maria,
 
Drive into this lawyers skull A few key things: 
 
- Her client has sent me three unsolicited proposals in 2025 - one of which with a timeline ultimatum they caused me undue harm and mental distress- Melissa’s proposed strategy is to circumvent lawyers as she put in writing
 
- Melissa’s proposals are so disconnected, Irrational and uneducated Throwing out proposed terms that would be detrimental to her own financial well-being- The words use in these emails are extremely elementary and so concerning that acting on them would be unethical
 
^^^ Proposing such terms, In the form of unsolicited proposals sent via email with the intent to Circumvent legal and then to pressure me with a time based ultimatum is extremely inappropriate and I let that be known 
 
 
^^^ please also note that I sent you the first proposal on February 25, 2025. For the sake of getting your information to issue a response, I won’t address The lack of response to review the proposal and also my request in that same email February 25 to your assistant to a meeting for the first available opening in your schedule. I need a lawyer to catch up and act and then we will discuss
 
Continuing…
 
- her client Deepens her track record of unilateral decision-making - late September 2024, which was Pre-October 1st 2024, (The day 1 that our condo became vacant from tenants offsetting a monthly fixed cost of $3500 required to service the condo)
 
I emailed Melissa in late September 2024 to remind her of this upcoming Obligation 
 
Melissa replied to my email In late September 2024. I can paraphrase her response as: “Go fuck yourself.” 
Although she use different words, she let it be known that her unilateral decision was to abandon financial obligation. 
 
Since, She has remained 100% disassociated with all costs while remaining very engaged in the activities around selling the property and her perceived proceeds to come from it. 
 
She further blocked me from a shared Gmail account we established in our marriage. Another example of an Another example of unilateral decision-making unilateral decision-making. 
 
Much of the admin for the condo’s cost obligation was managed through that email address. I have documented eight requests that I issued to her Since separation - essentially me pleading for her to share in the access that she restricted. 
 
Even while working on financial disclosure documentation, I wrote to Melissa and told her that to help my ability to provide a thorough financial disclosure having access to that email address was imperative because that email address is the username and associated email to multiple accounts that I manage related to the condominium. Even with that reasoning, she declined To share access and only out of spite. Melissa has served as a bump on a log that shifts and positions itself in unreasonable and unpredictable ways. I had no choice but to act independently and Pennsylvania State doctrine is clear and what it supports.
 
To go back further regarding unilateral decision-making. I was diagnosed with a disability related to my mental health in June 2024. In July 2024, Melissa voluntarily quit her job without telling me and I began August 2024 without the medical care that took months to set up. I was not even informed by Melissa herself. It took me asking Melissa the status of her employment for her to tell me that she quit at the end of July and benefits were lost on the last day of the month that she quit. 
 
So: 
 
1) Financial misconduct
 
2) Medical abandonment
 
3) Complete lie about me living at the condo - I have spent eight nights here since October 1, 2024, when the condo became vacant and the tenants left 
 
 
two nights were spent here for pleasure and six nights on necessity such as the last several nights as I wake up every day, servicing the property meeting with realtors and exploring creative ways to solve the issue related to our unsold Condo
 
.0119 % of the days since October 1, 2024 I have stayed at the condo based on non-necessity that being two nights out of 168 possible nights
 
 
.0357 % of the day since October 1, 2024 I have stayed at the condo based purely on the necessity to be here for Service repairs cleaners meeting with realtors showing the condo to real estate investors that being six nights out of of 168 possible nights

To: Stephen Boerner <stephen.boerner@gmail.com>


Steve,

I received your email of concerns. In an effort to wrap up this process, which I know is something we both want, I am reaching out with a proposal hoping we can agree on something to bring to our lawyers to draft up.  We had a short term marriage with little assets, I am sure we can both agree it's a waste to spend more money on lawyers going back and forth. We both have the documents so here is what I propose and you can review and get back to me if you have changes and/or if you are willing to resolve this.

Proposed Settlement:
1. We each keep our own 401Ks
2. We each keep our savings/checking accounts
3. Split value of the jeep 50/50
4. Condo: split the net proceeds 50/50 (we can discuss the mortgage payments you have made October 2024-now).
5. Crypto was worth $43,517.20 as of the end of June 2024. Split this amount 50/50.
6. Each person is responsible for their own liabilities (including credit cards, my student loan, etc).

Dear Maria,
 
 
 
I hope you’re doing well. I wanted to provide some updates on recent developments with Melissa and seek your guidance on several matters. Additionally, seeking a copy of our response. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
1.
Request for Copy of Our Legal Response
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• Could you please share a copy of our legal response to Melissa’s initial divorce filing (our Answer and any Counterclaims)? I’d like to review it for my records.
Hi, it is the same document I sent to you for review prior to filing!  The time-stamped version is attached or your records.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• I understand the ball is in her court now. Could you provide an estimated timeline for their response? This would help me mentally prepare for this phase and alleviate some stress during the waiting period.
 
 
 
 
 They do not need to file a response; you did an Answer to her divorce.  The next thing is to do discovery; the request for documents.  Once requested, there is a 30 day period for which to provide them. 
 
 
 
2.
Communication via Lawyer
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• Melissa has demanded that I cease all direct communication with her and route all interactions through her lawyer.
 
 
 
 
 That is unreasonable and unnecessarily costly.  You have no obligation to adhere to that demand. 
 
 
 
 
• Initially, we agreed to work together amicably to close out accounts and address loose ends, but this has changed.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
3.
Verizon Account
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• Melissa, as the primary holder of our joint Verizon Wireless account, initiated splitting the account.
 
 
 
 
• I assisted by joining the call with Verizon and providing any necessary two-factor authentication codes, fulfilling our prior agreement.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
4.
PECO Energy Account and Condo Preparations
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• Our tenants moved out at the end of September from our jointly owned condo.
 
 
 
 
• I transferred the PECO energy account into my name to ensure we have power for open houses and showings.
 
 
 
 
• Melissa delayed providing a two-factor authentication code needed for the transfer, resulting in about a week without power at the condo, which hindered repair work and preparations.
 
 
 
 
• She eventually provided the necessary information, but the delay caused significant inconvenience.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
5.
Access to Joint Gmail Account
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• We have a joint Gmail account (stephenandmelissaboerner@gmail.com) used for shared utilities and subscriptions.
 
 
 
 
• Melissa set up the account through her phone, and I cannot access it without a two-factor authentication code sent to her device.
 
 
 
 
• She has ignored multiple requests to grant me access to this mutually owned account.
 
 
 
 
• Since she insists on all communication going through her lawyer, I’m unable to resolve this directly with her.
 
 
 
 
• Attachments: Screenshots documenting these issues.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
6.
Mortgage and HOA Contributions
 
 
 
 
• Melissa has decided not to contribute to the monthly mortgage payments starting October 2024—the first month without tenants in our condo.
 
 
 
 
• The monthly mortgage is approximately $2,400, including around $530 in escrow for Philadelphia property taxes.
 
 
 
 
• Additionally, there are HOA dues of approximately $800 per month.
 
 
 
 
• I have made the October mortgage and HOA payments in full without any contribution from her.
 
 
 
 
• Back on July 17, 2024, she stated in a text message that she expects a fair split of the condo proceeds, yet currently, I’m shouldering all the expenses.
 
 
 
 
• Attachments: Screenshots of payments and the aforementioned text message.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
7.
Financial Strain and Impact on Business
 
 
 
 
• Covering these expenses alone is depleting my cash reserves.
 
 
 
 
• This financial strain is significantly hindering my ability to focus on my startup and generate revenue.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Questions and Requests
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
1.
Documentation Guidance
 
 
 
• To what extent should I be documenting these financial contributions and communication issues?
 
 
The condo was not used as the marital residence, so you will have an argument for a credit for what you paid.  But, if it is too much, then perhaps listing it for sale makes sense?  
 
I would like proof of payments you make towards the condo, so we have it for the credit request.  
 
 
• Should I include these expenses in the financial summary in response to what they will send us, given that I am currently covering these payments alone?
 
 
Yes, you should.  
 
 
2. Joint Gmail Account Access
 
 
 
 
• Is there any action we can take regarding Melissa’s refusal to share access to our joint Gmail account? This hinders my ability to manage our shared responsibilities.
 
 Yes, we can certainly request the information.  Or, since you are managing the property, you could create a new email address that she cannot use.  Is that an option?  
 
 
3. Shared Expenses
 
 
 
 
• What can be done about Melissa’s lack of contribution to shared expenses, given our mutual ownership of the property?
 
 You are divorcing and you did not reside in this residence, so there is no presumption you should share the expenses.  Therefore, most people would either re-rent the property or list it for sale.  She cannot be forced to share in these expenses.  
 
 
4. Relevance of Attachments
 
 
 
 
• Please advise if the attached screenshots will be relevant in the broader scheme of things.
 
 
 
 They are relevant to show she would not pay for the condo.  I don’t think the fact that she won’t communicate with you other than through attorney’s is needed other than to show she won’t do it.  
 
 
 
Thank you for your assistance. I appreciate your guidance on these matters and look forward to your response.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Best regards,
 
Stephen

Maria,
 
I’ve been struggling to decide what the best course of action is. I think it would be helpful if we could talk about this further. I’m available via my cell phone today, but I’m also traveling and have flight details below.
 
Tomorrow might be a better time to talk, but I’d like to find a way to speak as soon as possible. I’m trying to be flexible and can make time today.
 
One important point is that she wants me to pay for her expensive lawyer at the end of this. However, I’ve already spent thousands of dollars on car rental and transportation services for myself and my service dog, who supports my PTSD. The PTSD was triggered by a home invasion in Gulfport, Florida, on March 26, 2024, when I had a physical altercation with an intruder in our home while trying to protect our family.
 
As of this morning, Friday, September 13, 2024, and almost two months since she took the Jeep with the intention of keeping it, I’ll be picking it up and taking it to a service station so McKenna can fix the wear and tear that has accumulated during her cross-country drives since then.
 
I’ve had to rent almost four cars to make ends meet, and I also had to rent a large moving SUV that cost over $2000 to move her belongings and mine out of the home we rented together in Gulfport, Florida. She left me alone to handle all of this on my own.
 
As of this morning, I’ve arrived in the northeast with the belongings I could salvage and my service dog. We have a place to stay in Austin, Texas, until October 6, 2024, when I’ll return to the Philadelphia area. At that time, I’ll collect the Jeep that’s going to be serviced while I’m away and drive it to Rock Hall, Maryland.
 
My parents have kindly allowed me to use their mostly vacant retirement condo as my next residential address and mailing address. I’ve provided that address below, and it will serve as my mailing address moving forward. Please don’t send any mail to my previously leased in Gulfport, Florida.

With all that said, I just don’t know how to interpret the request for support and what that means related to the divorce as a whole you mention that her filing excluded, a deeper dive into everything that I own, but I don’t quite recall. It was something that you were surprised she left out 
 
Anyway I would like to talk through this before making such a pivotal decision.

For the counter-claim, I highlighted the two counts I was not sure you wanted to include.  We discussed her ability to work and that you are between jobs (start-up and no paycheck since 12.23), but I didn’t think you wanted to file for support.  I put them in there and can remove them.
 
Otherwise, let me know if other changes are needed!  If not, confirm I can file!

Maria, 
 
Please read my last email and take a look at the three attachments. 
 
I'm sending this second email to correct a mistake in one of those three attachments. Please ignore the form information sheet I provided you in the first email. The form information sheet had errors, as I sent you an address with typos and missed a few fields. I've corrected the form and reattached it to this second email.
 
I plan to change my registered residential address in early October. Between now and then, I will be spending time in Austin, Texas. I will be in Austin (and on Central Time) from September 9th to October 6th. 
 
At that time, I fly to Rock Hall, Maryland, at which point I will register for a Driver's License change in residential address and shift from a Floridian to a state of Maryland resident until I get through this divorce. Thank you. 
 
See the attached revised version.

﻿ 
Maria,
 
I’ve been struggling to decide what the best course of action is. I think it would be helpful if we could talk about this further. I’m available via my cell phone today, but I’m also traveling and have flight details below.
 
Tomorrow might be a better time to talk, but I’d like to find a way to speak as soon as possible. I’m trying to be flexible and can make time today.
 
One important point is that she wants me to pay for her expensive lawyer at the end of this. However, I’ve already spent thousands of dollars on car rental and transportation services for myself and my service dog, who supports my PTSD. The PTSD was triggered by a home invasion in Gulfport, Florida, on March 26, 2024, when I had a physical altercation with an intruder in our home while trying to protect our family.
 
As of this morning, Friday, September 13, 2024, and almost two months since she took the Jeep with the intention of keeping it, I’ll be picking it up and taking it to a service station so McKenna can fix the wear and tear that has accumulated during her cross-country drives since then.
 
I’ve had to rent almost four cars to make ends meet, and I also had to rent a large moving SUV that cost over $2000 to move her belongings and mine out of the home we rented together in Gulfport, Florida. She left me alone to handle all of this on my own.
 
As of this morning, I’ve arrived in the northeast with the belongings I could salvage and my service dog. We have a place to stay in Austin, Texas, until October 6, 2024, when I’ll return to the Philadelphia area. At that time, I’ll collect the Jeep that’s going to be serviced while I’m away and drive it to Rock Hall, Maryland.
 
My parents have kindly allowed me to use their mostly vacant retirement condo as my next residential address and mailing address. I’ve provided that address below, and it will serve as my mailing address moving forward. Please don’t send any mail to my previously leased in Gulfport, Florida.

With all that said, I just don’t know how to interpret the request for support and what that means related to the divorce as a whole you mention that her filing excluded, a deeper dive into everything that I own, but I don’t quite recall. It was something that you were surprised she left out 
 
Anyway I would like to talk through this before making such a pivotal decision.
 
215 530 0545
 
Steve
 
ps… I am available on my cell phone before 10 AM this morning or after 6 PM with a brief layover around 1 PM est

Hi,
 
Attached is the drafted Answer and Counterclaim.
 
For the counter-claim, I highlighted the two counts I was not sure you wanted to include.  We discussed her ability to work and that you are between jobs (start-up and no paycheck since 12.23), but I didn’t think you wanted to file for support.  I put them in there and can remove them.
 
Otherwise, let me know if other changes are needed!  If not, confirm I can file!

Maria,
 
I’ve been struggling to decide what the best course of action is. I think it would be helpful if we could talk about this further. I’m available via my cell phone today, but I’m also traveling and have flight details below.
 
Tomorrow might be a better time to talk, but I’d like to find a way to speak as soon as possible. I’m trying to be flexible and can make time today.
 
One important point is that she wants me to pay for her expensive lawyer at the end of this. However, I’ve already spent thousands of dollars on car rental and transportation services for myself and my service dog, who supports my PTSD. The PTSD was triggered by a home invasion in Gulfport, Florida, on March 26, 2024, when I had a physical altercation with an intruder in our home while trying to protect our family.
 
As of this morning, Friday, September 13, 2024, and almost two months since she took the Jeep with the intention of keeping it, I’ll be picking it up and taking it to a service station so McKenna can fix the wear and tear that has accumulated during her cross-country drives since then.
 
I’ve had to rent almost four cars to make ends meet, and I also had to rent a large moving SUV that cost over $2000 to move her belongings and mine out of the home we rented together in Gulfport, Florida. She left me alone to handle all of this on my own.
 
As of this morning, I’ve arrived in the northeast with the belongings I could salvage and my service dog. We have a place to stay in Austin, Texas, until October 6, 2024, when I’ll return to the Philadelphia area. At that time, I’ll collect the Jeep that’s going to be serviced while I’m away and drive it to Rock Hall, Maryland.
 
My parents have kindly allowed me to use their mostly vacant retirement condo as my next residential address and mailing address. I’ve provided that address below, and it will serve as my mailing address moving forward. Please don’t send any mail to my previously leased in Gulfport, Florida.

With all that said, I just don’t know how to interpret the request for support and what that means related to the divorce as a whole you mention that her filing excluded, a deeper dive into everything that I own, but I don’t quite recall. It was something that you were surprised she left out 
 
Anyway I would like to talk through this before making such a pivotal decision.

Hi,
 
Attached is the drafted Answer and Counterclaim.
 
For the counter-claim, I highlighted the two counts I was not sure you wanted to include.  We discussed her ability to work and that you are between jobs (start-up and no paycheck since 12.23), but I didn’t think you wanted to file for support.  I put them in there and can remove them.
 
Otherwise, let me know if other changes are needed!  If not, confirm I can file!

Maria, 
 
Please read my last email and take a look at the three attachments. 
 
I'm sending this second email to correct a mistake in one of those three attachments. Please ignore the form information sheet I provided you in the first email. The form information sheet had errors, as I sent you an address with typos and missed a few fields. I've corrected the form and reattached it to this second email.
 
I plan to change my registered residential address in early October. Between now and then, I will be spending time in Austin, Texas. I will be in Austin (and on Central Time) from September 9th to October 6th. 
 
At that time, I fly to Rock Hall, Maryland, at which point I will register for a Driver's License change in residential address and shift from a Floridian to a state of Maryland resident until I get through this divorce. Thank you. 
 
See the attached revised version.

Maria,
 
I’ve been struggling to decide what the best course of action is. I think it would be helpful if we could talk about this further. I’m available via my cell phone today, but I’m also traveling and have flight details below.
 
Tomorrow might be a better time to talk, but I’d like to find a way to speak as soon as possible. I’m trying to be flexible and can make time today.
 
One important point is that she wants me to pay for her expensive lawyer at the end of this. However, I’ve already spent thousands of dollars on car rental and transportation services for myself and my service dog, who supports my PTSD. The PTSD was triggered by a home invasion in Gulfport, Florida, on March 26, 2024, when I had a physical altercation with an intruder in our home while trying to protect our family.
 
As of this morning, Friday, September 13, 2024, and almost two months since she took the Jeep with the intention of keeping it, I’ll be picking it up and taking it to a service station so McKenna can fix the wear and tear that has accumulated during her cross-country drives since then.
 
I’ve had to rent almost four cars to make ends meet, and I also had to rent a large moving SUV that cost over $2000 to move her belongings and mine out of the home we rented together in Gulfport, Florida. She left me alone to handle all of this on my own.
 
As of this morning, I’ve arrived in the northeast with the belongings I could salvage and my service dog. We have a place to stay in Austin, Texas, until October 6, 2024, when I’ll return to the Philadelphia area. At that time, I’ll collect the Jeep that’s going to be serviced while I’m away and drive it to Rock Hall, Maryland.
 
My parents have kindly allowed me to use their mostly vacant retirement condo as my next residential address and mailing address. I’ve provided that address below, and it will serve as my mailing address moving forward. Please don’t send any mail to my previously leased in Gulfport, Florida.

With all that said, I just don’t know how to interpret the request for support and what that means related to the divorce as a whole you mention that her filing excluded, a deeper dive into everything that I own, but I don’t quite recall. It was something that you were surprised she left out 
 
Anyway I would like to talk through this before making such a pivotal decision.

Hi,
 
Attached is the drafted Answer and Counterclaim.
 
For the counter-claim, I highlighted the two counts I was not sure you wanted to include.  We discussed her ability to work and that you are between jobs (start-up and no paycheck since 12.23), but I didn’t think you wanted to file for support.  I put them in there and can remove them.
 
Otherwise, let me know if other changes are needed!  If not, confirm I can file!

Maria, 
 
Please read my last email and take a look at the three attachments. 
 
I'm sending this second email to correct a mistake in one of those three attachments. Please ignore the form information sheet I provided you in the first email. The form information sheet had errors, as I sent you an address with typos and missed a few fields. I've corrected the form and reattached it to this second email.
 
I plan to change my registered residential address in early October. Between now and then, I will be spending time in Austin, Texas. I will be in Austin (and on Central Time) from September 9th to October 6th. 
 
At that time, I fly to Rock Hall, Maryland, at which point I will register for a Driver's License change in residential address and shift from a Floridian to a state of Maryland resident until I get through this divorce. Thank you. 
 
See the attached revised version. 
 
Steve

Maria,

I’ve been struggling to decide what the best course of action is. I think it would be helpful if we could talk about this further. I’m available via my cell phone today, but I’m also traveling and have flight details below.

Tomorrow might be a better time to talk, but I’d like to find a way to speak as soon as possible. I’m trying to be flexible and can make time today.

One important point is that she wants me to pay for her expensive lawyer at the end of this. However, I’ve already spent thousands of dollars on car rental and transportation services for myself and my service dog, who supports my PTSD. The PTSD was triggered by a home invasion in Gulfport, Florida, on March 26, 2024, when I had a physical altercation with an intruder in our home while trying to protect our family.

As of this morning, Friday, September 13, 2024, and almost two months since she took the Jeep with the intention of keeping it, I’ll be picking it up and taking it to a service station so McKenna can fix the wear and tear that has accumulated during her cross-country drives since then.

I’ve had to rent almost four cars to make ends meet, and I also had to rent a large moving SUV that cost over $2000 to move her belongings and mine out of the home we rented together in Gulfport, Florida. She left me alone to handle all of this on my own.

As of this morning, I’ve arrived in the northeast with the belongings I could salvage and my service dog. We have a place to stay in Austin, Texas, until October 6, 2024, when I’ll return to the Philadelphia area. At that time, I’ll collect the Jeep that’s going to be serviced while I’m away and drive it to Rock Hall, Maryland.

My parents have kindly allowed me to use their mostly vacant retirement condo as my next residential address and mailing address. I’ve provided that address below, and it will serve as my mailing address moving forward. Please don’t send any mail to my previously leased in Gulfport, Florida.

With all that said, I just don’t know how to interpret the request for support and what that means related to the divorce as a whole you mention that her filing excluded, a deeper dive into everything that I own, but I don’t quite recall. It was something that you were surprised she left out 

Anyway I would like to talk through this before making such a pivotal decision.

For the counter-claim, I highlighted the two counts I was not sure you wanted to include.  We discussed her ability to work and that you are between jobs (start-up and no paycheck since 12.23), but I didn’t think you wanted to file for support.  I put them in there and can remove them.
 
Otherwise, let me know if other changes are needed!  If not, confirm I can file!

Maria, 
 
Please read my last email and take a look at the three attachments. 
 
I'm sending this second email to correct a mistake in one of those three attachments. Please ignore the form information sheet I provided you in the first email. The form information sheet had errors, as I sent you an address with typos and missed a few fields. I've corrected the form and reattached it to this second email.
 
I plan to change my registered residential address in early October. Between now and then, I will be spending time in Austin, Texas. I will be in Austin (and on Central Time) from September 9th to October 6th. 
 
At that time, I fly to Rock Hall, Maryland, at which point I will register for a Driver's License change in residential address and shift from a Floridian to a state of Maryland resident until I get through this divorce. Thank you. 
 
See the attached revised version. 
 
Steve

Hi,

Based on your email, you’re really only available before 10am within normally hours and I have a hearing beginning at 9 this am.  I will be with my client beforehand.

I can chat at 6, but since I will be with my children and running them around, I can offer 30 minutes.  I hope that works.  

I will call you then.

Maria,

I’ve been struggling to decide what the best course of action is. I think it would be helpful if we could talk about this further. I’m available via my cell phone today, but I’m also traveling and have flight details below.

Tomorrow might be a better time to talk, but I’d like to find a way to speak as soon as possible. I’m trying to be flexible and can make time today.

One important point is that she wants me to pay for her expensive lawyer at the end of this. However, I’ve already spent thousands of dollars on car rental and transportation services for myself and my service dog, who supports my PTSD. The PTSD was triggered by a home invasion in Gulfport, Florida, on March 26, 2024, when I had a physical altercation with an intruder in our home while trying to protect our family.

As of this morning, Friday, September 13, 2024, and almost two months since she took the Jeep with the intention of keeping it, I’ll be picking it up and taking it to a service station so McKenna can fix the wear and tear that has accumulated during her cross-country drives since then.

I’ve had to rent almost four cars to make ends meet, and I also had to rent a large moving SUV that cost over $2000 to move her belongings and mine out of the home we rented together in Gulfport, Florida. She left me alone to handle all of this on my own.

As of this morning, I’ve arrived in the northeast with the belongings I could salvage and my service dog. We have a place to stay in Austin, Texas, until October 6, 2024, when I’ll return to the Philadelphia area. At that time, I’ll collect the Jeep that’s going to be serviced while I’m away and drive it to Rock Hall, Maryland.

My parents have kindly allowed me to use their mostly vacant retirement condo as my next residential address and mailing address. I’ve provided that address below, and it will serve as my mailing address moving forward. Please don’t send any mail to my previously leased in Gulfport, Florida.

Stephen Boerner 
Rock Hall Landing 
21090 W Sharp Street, Unit #132 
Rock Hall, MD 21661

With all that said, I just don’t know how to interpret the request for support and what that means related to the divorce as a whole you mention that her filing excluded, a deeper dive into everything that I own, but I don’t quite recall. It was something that you were surprised she left out 

Anyway I would like to talk through this before making such a pivotal decision.

215 530 0545

Steve

ps… I am available on my cell phone before 10 AM this morning or after 6 PM with a brief layover around 1 PM est

Hi, 
 
It was such a pleasure chatting.  
 
As discussed, I have attached the documents needed for filing.  The documents are as follows:  
 
	1.	Verification: This needs to be signed and dated.  This document is going to be attached to any pleading we file.  I will send all pleadings to you to review prior to filing. 
 
	2.	Domestic Relations Information Sheet: Please provide your name, address, social security number, and date of birth.  Please provide the same information for the opposing party, minus their social security number if you do not have it.  Please provide the name and date of birth of any children.  
 
I am also attaching a fee agreement for your review.  Once you are ready to move forward, please simply pay the fee with the payment link provided and I can begin.  Here is the payment link for your convenience: https://secure.lawpay.com/pages/testaandpagnanellillc/operating
 
My cell is 267.312.1810, so you have it. 
 
If you have any questions, please let me know!  
 
 
Thank you!
