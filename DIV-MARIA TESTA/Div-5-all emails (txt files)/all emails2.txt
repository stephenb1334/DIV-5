I think it would be helpful if we could talk about this further. I’m available via my cell phone today, but I’m also traveling and have ﬂight details below. Tomorrow might be a better time to talk, but I’d like to ﬁnd a way to speak as soon as possible. I’m trying to be ﬂexible and can make time today. One important point is that she wants me to pay for her expensive lawyer at the end of this. However, I’ve already spent thousands of dollars on car rental and transportation services for myself and my service dog, who supports my PTSD. The PTSD was triggered by a home invasion in Gulfport, Florida, on March 26, 2024, when I had a physical altercation with an intruder in our home while trying to protect our family. As of this morning, Friday, September 13, 2024, and almost two months since she took the Jeep with the intention of keeping it, I’ll be picking it up and taking it to a service station so McKenna can ﬁx the wear and tear that has accumulated during her cross-country drives since then. I’ve had to rent almost four cars to make ends meet, and I also had to rent a large moving SUV that cost over $2000 to move her belongings and mine out of the home we rented together in Gulfport, Florida. She left me alone to handle all of this on my own. As of this morning, I’ve arrived in the northeast with the belongings I could salvage and my service dog. We have a place to stay in Austin, Texas, until October 6, 2024, when I’ll return to the Philadelphia area. At that time, I’ll collect the Jeep that’s going to be serviced while I’m away and drive it to Rock Hall, Maryland. My parents have kindly allowed me to use their mostly vacant retirement condo as my next residential address and mailing address. I’ve provided that address below, and it will serve as my mailing address moving forward. Please don’t send any mail to my previously leased in Gulfport, Florida.

I think it would be helpful if we could talk about this further. I’m available via my cell phone today, but I’m also traveling and have ﬂight details below. Tomorrow might be a better time to talk, but I’d like to ﬁnd a way to speak as soon as possible. I’m trying to be ﬂexible and can make time today. One important point is that she wants me to pay for her expensive lawyer at the end of this. However, I’ve already spent thousands of dollars on car rental and transportation services for myself and my service dog, who supports my PTSD. The PTSD was triggered by a home invasion in Gulfport, Florida, on March 26, 2024, when I had a physical altercation with an intruder in our home while trying to protect our family. As of this morning, Friday, September 13, 2024, and almost two months since she took the Jeep with the intention of keeping it, I’ll be picking it up and taking it to a service station so McKenna can ﬁx the wear and tear that has accumulated during her cross-country drives since then. I’ve had to rent almost four cars to make ends meet, and I also had to rent a large moving SUV that cost over $2000 to move her belongings and mine out of the home we rented together in Gulfport, Florida. She left me alone to handle all of this on my own. As of this morning, I’ve arrived in the northeast with the belongings I could salvage and my service dog. We have a place to stay in Austin, Texas, until October 6, 2024, when I’ll return to the Philadelphia area. At that time, I’ll collect the Jeep that’s going to be serviced while I’m away and drive it to Rock Hall, Maryland. My parents have kindly allowed me to use their mostly vacant retirement condo as my next residential address and mailing address. I’ve provided that address below, and it will serve as my mailing address moving forward. Please don’t send any mail to my previously leased in Gulfport, Florida. Stephen Boerner Rock Hall Landing 21090 W Sharp Street, Unit #132 Rock Hall, MD 21661 With all that said, I just don’t know how to interpret the request for support and what that means related to the divorce as a whole you mention that her ﬁling excluded, a deeper dive into everything that I own, but I don’t quite recall.

However, I’ve already spent thousands of dollars on car rental and transportation services for myself and my service dog, who supports my PTSD. The PTSD was triggered by a home invasion in Gulfport, Florida, on March 26, 2024, when I had a physical altercation with an intruder in our home while trying to protect our family. As of this morning, Friday, September 13, 2024, and almost two months since she took the Jeep with the intention of keeping it, I’ll be picking it up and taking it to a service station so McKenna can ﬁx the wear and tear that has accumulated during her cross-country drives since then. I’ve had to rent almost four cars to make ends meet, and I also had to rent a large moving SUV that cost over $2000 to move her belongings and mine out of the home we rented together in Gulfport, Florida. She left me alone to handle all of this on my own. As of this morning, I’ve arrived in the northeast with the belongings I could salvage and my service dog. We have a place to stay in Austin, Texas, until October 6, 2024, when I’ll return to the Philadelphia area. At that time, I’ll collect the Jeep that’s going to be serviced while I’m away and drive it to Rock Hall, Maryland. My parents have kindly allowed me to use their mostly vacant retirement condo as my next residential address and mailing address.

I wanted to provide some updates on recent developments with Melissa and seek your guidance on several matters. Additionally, seeking a copy of our response. 1. Request for Copy of Our Legal Response •Could you please share a copy of our legal response to Melissa’s initial divorce ﬁling (our Answer and any Counterclaims)? I’d like to review it for my records. •I understand the ball is in her court now. Could you provide an estimated timeline for their response? This would help me mentally prepare for this phase and alleviate some stress during the waiting period. 2. Communication via Lawyer • Melissa has demanded that I cease all direct communication with her and route all interactions through her lawyer. •Initially, we agreed to work together amicably to close out accounts and address loose ends, but this has changed. 3. Verizon Account • Melissa, as the primary holder of our joint Verizon Wireless account, initiated splitting the account. •I assisted by joining the call with Verizon and providing any necessary two-factor authentication codes, fulﬁlling our prior agreement. 4. PECO Energy Account and Condo Preparations •Our tenants moved out at the end of September from our jointly owned condo. •I transferred the PECO energy account into my name to ensure we have power for open houses and showings. • Melissa delayed providing a two-factor authentication code needed for the transfer, resulting in about a week without power at the condo, which hindered repair work and preparations. • She eventually provided the necessary information, but the delay caused signiﬁcant inconvenience. 5. Access to Joint Gmail Account •We have a joint Gmail account and subscriptions. • Melissa set up the account through her phone, and I cannot access it without a two-factor authentication code sent to her device. • She has ignored multiple requests to grant me access to this mutually owned account. • Since she insists on all communication going through her lawyer, I’m unable to resolve this directly with her. • Attachments: Screenshots documenting these issues. 6. Mortgage and HOA Contributions • Melissa has decided not to contribute to the monthly mortgage payments starting October 2024—the ﬁrst month without tenants in our condo. •The monthly mortgage is approximately $2,400, including around $530 in escrow for Philadelphia property taxes. • Additionally, there are HOA dues of approximately $800 per month. •I have made the October mortgage and HOA payments in full without any contribution from her. • Back on July 17, 2024, she stated in a text message that she expects a fair split of the condo proceeds, yet currently, I’m shouldering all the expenses. • Attachments: Screenshots of payments and the aforementioned text message. 7. Financial Strain and Impact on Business • Covering these expenses alone is depleting my cash reserves. •This ﬁnancial strain is signiﬁcantly hindering my ability to focus on my startup and generate revenue. Questions and Requests 1. Documentation Guidance •To what extent should I be documenting these ﬁnancial contributions and communication issues? • Should I include these expenses in the ﬁnancial summary in response to what they will send us, given that I am currently covering these payments alone? 2. Joint Gmail Account Access •Is there any action we can take regarding Melissa’s refusal to share access to our joint Gmail account? This hinders my ability to manage our shared responsibilities. 3. Shared Expenses •What can be done about Melissa’s lack of contribution to shared expenses, given our mutual ownership of the property? 4. Relevance of Attachments • Please advise if the attached screenshots will be relevant in the broader scheme of things. Thank you for your assistance. I appreciate your guidance on these matters and look forward to your response. Best regards, Stephen On Wed, Oct 9, 2024 at 7:25 PM Maria Testa, Esquire <maria@tpfamilylaw.com> wrote: Hi, It has been submitted; waiting for the timestamp.

I wanted to provide some updates on recent developments with Melissa and seek your guidance on several matters. Additionally, seeking a copy of our response. 1. Request for Copy of Our Legal Response •Could you please share a copy of our legal response to Melissa’s initial divorce filing (our Answer and any Counterclaims)? I’d like to review it for my records. Hi, it is the same document I sent to you for review prior to ﬁling! The time-stamped version is attached or your records. •I understand the ball is in her court now. Could you provide an estimated timeline for their response?

The next thing is to do discovery; the request for documents. Once requested, there is a 30 day period for which to provide them. 2. Communication via Lawyer • Melissa has demanded that I cease all direct communication with her and route all interactions through her lawyer. That is unreasonable and unnecessarily costly. You have no obligation to adhere to that demand. •Initially, we agreed to work together amicably to close out accounts and address loose ends, but this has changed. 3. Verizon Account • Melissa, as the primary holder of our joint Verizon Wireless account, initiated splitting the account. •I assisted by joining the call with Verizon and providing any necessary two-factor authentication codes, fulfilling our prior agreement. 4. PECO Energy Account and Condo Preparations •Our tenants moved out at the end of September from our jointly owned condo. •I transferred the PECO energy account into my name to ensure we have power for open houses and showings. • Melissa delayed providing a two-factor authentication code needed for the transfer, resulting in about a week without power at the condo, which hindered repair work and preparations. • She eventually provided the necessary information, but the delay caused significant inconvenience. 5. Access to Joint Gmail Account •We have a joint Gmail account and subscriptions. • Melissa set up the account through her phone, and I cannot access it without a two-factor authentication code sent to her device. • She has ignored multiple requests to grant me access to this mutually owned account. • Since she insists on all communication going through her l I’m unable l this di l with her lawyer, I’m unable to resolve this directly with her. • Attachments: Screenshots documenting these issues. 6.

Financial Strain and Impact on Business • Covering these expenses alone is depleting my cash reserves. •This financial strain is significantly hindering my ability to focus on my startup and generate revenue. Questions and Requests 1. Documentation Guidance •To what extent should I be documenting these financial contributions and communication issues? The condo was not used as the marital residence, so you will have an argument for a credit for what you paid. But, if it is too much, then perhaps listing it for sale makes sense? I would like proof of payments you make towards the condo, so we have it for the credit request. • Should I include these expenses in the financial summary in response to what they will send us, given that I am currently covering these payments alone? Yes, you should. 2. Joint Gmail Account Access •Is there any action we can take regarding Melissa’s refusal to share access to our joint Gmail account? This hinders my ability to manage our shared responsibilities. Yes, we can certainly request the information. Or, since you are managing the property, you could create a new email address that she cannot use. Is that an option? 3. Shared Expenses •What can be done about Melissa’s lack of contribution to shared expenses, given our mutual ownership of the property? You are divorcing and you did not reside in this residence, so there is no presumption you should share the expenses. Therefore, most people would either re-rent the property or list it for sale. She cannot be forced to share in these expenses. 4. Relevance of Attachments • Please advise if the attached screenshots will be relevant in the broader scheme of things. They are relevant to show she would not pay for the condo. I don’t think the fact that she won’t communicate with you other than through attorney’s is needed other than to show she won’t do it. won’t do it. Thank you for your assistance. I appreciate your guidance on these matters and look forward to your response. Best regards, Stephen On Wed, Oct 9, 2024 at 7:25 PM Maria Testa, Esquire <maria@tpfamilylaw.com> wrote: Hi, It has been submitted; waiting for the timestamp.

I think it would be helpful if we could talk about this further. I’m available via my cell phone today, but I’m also traveling and have ﬂight details below. Tomorrow might be a better time to talk, but I’d like to ﬁnd a way to speak as soon as possible. I’m trying to be ﬂexible and can make time today. One important point is that she wants me to pay for her expensive lawyer at the end of this. However, I’ve already spent thousands of dollars on car rental and transportation services for myself and my service dog, who supports my PTSD. The PTSD was triggered by a home invasion in Gulfport, Florida, on March 26, 2024, when I had a physical altercation with an intruder when I had a physical altercation with an intruder in our home while trying to protect our family. <stephen.boerner@gmail.com> wrote: As of this morning, Friday, September 13, 2024, and almost two months since she took the Jeep with the intention of keeping it, I’ll be picking it up and taking it to a service station so McKenna can ﬁx the wear and tear that has accumulated during her cross-country drives since then. I’ve had to rent almost four cars to make ends meet, and I also had to rent a large moving SUV that cost over $2000 to move her belongings and mine out of the home we rented together in Gulfport, Florida. She left me alone to handle all of this on my own. As of this morning, I’ve arrived in the northeast with the belongings I could salvage and my service dog. We have a place to stay in Austin, Texas, until October 6, 2024, when I’ll return to the Philadelphia area. At that time, I’ll collect the Jeep that’s going to be serviced while I’m away and drive it to Rock Hall, Maryland. My parents have kindly allowed me to use their mostly vacant retirement condo as my next residential address and mailing address. I’ve provided that address below, and it will serve as my mailing address moving forward. Please don’t send any mail to my previously leased in Gulfport, Florida. Stephen Boerner Rock Hall Landing Rock Hall, MD 21661 With all that said, I just don’t know how to interpret the request for support and what that means related to the divorce as a whole you mention that her ﬁling excluded, a deeper dive into everything that I own, but I don’t quite recall. It was something that you were surprised she left out Anyway I would like to talk through this before making such a pivotal decision. 215 530 0545 215 530 0545 Steve ps… I am available on my cell phone before 10 AM this morning or after 6 PM with a brief layover around 1 PM est On Tue, Sep 10, 2024 at 4:30 PM Maria Testa, Hi, Attached is the drafted Answer and Counterclaim. For the counter-claim, I highlighted the two counts I was not sure you wanted to include. We discussed her ability to work and that you are between jobs (start-up and no paycheck since 12.23), but I didn’t think you wanted to ﬁle for support. I put them in there and can remove them. Otherwise, let me know if other changes are needed! If not, conﬁrm I can ﬁle! Testa & Pagnanelli, LLC <image002.jpg> 325 Swede Street | Suite 201 | Norristown, PA 19401 t 610.239.1000 | f 215.814.8998 https://www.tpfamilylaw.com/ Facebook |LinkedIn Send Mail to Norristown Ofﬁce Only With Satellite Ofﬁces in: 1515 Market Street Suite 1200 Philadelphia, PA 19102 Radnor 150 N.
