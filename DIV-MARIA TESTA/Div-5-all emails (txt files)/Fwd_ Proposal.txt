Steve,

I received your email of concerns. In an effort to wrap up this process,
which I know is something we both want, I am reaching out with a proposal
hoping we can agree on something to bring to our lawyers to draft up.  We
had a short term marriage with little assets, I am sure we can both agree
it's a waste to spend more money on lawyers going back and forth. We both
have the documents so here is what I propose and you can review and get
back to me if you have changes and/or if you are willing to resolve this.

Proposed Settlement:
1. We each keep our own 401Ks
2. We each keep our savings/checking accounts
3. Split value of the jeep 50/50
4. Condo: split the net proceeds 50/50 (we can discuss the mortgage
payments you have made October 2024-now).
5. Crypto was worth $43,517.20 as of the end of June 2024. Split this
amount 50/50.
6. Each person is responsible for their own liabilities (including credit
cards, my student loan, etc).
