The payment is due and your client has not paid his half. Please advise this will be completed today. My client is concerned about your client\'92s lack of response to the bills being due considering he was so aggressive when he wanted to change realtors.

Maria: I will address issues you raised in your email to me and reserve my client\'92s right to argue your client has dissipated the marital estate in the divorce. \
With respect to the condo, my client has met with the realtor and has signed the listing agreement. It my understanding the condo is now listed for sale. Please note, my client is reserving the right to argue the listing price is below market value but she is aware the parties need to get the condo sold. There remains outstanding HOA fees in excess of $3,500 which your client has not paid. My client will be paying $1,000 towards the fees and she is asking that your client to also pay $1000 towards the outstanding fees.\'a0 Additionally, for the next three months the parties shall equally divide the costs of the HOA fees moving forward. \
With respect to the mortgage, my client is willing to equally divide this expense as well for the next three months. If the house does not sell in the next three months the parties will have to reassess payment of the costs.\
Finally, please have your client provide a full accounting of the cryptocurrency account he depleted. I previously requested this information in discovery and have not received a response. Please also confirm your client will pay his share of the obligations for the next three months. Thank you ~ Carolyn \

Hello,\
\'a0\
Unfortunately, your client has given you information based on inaccuracies and half-truths. \
\'a0\
For clarification, your client was aware of the Realtor situation; as there have been a series of issues with this individual, including her failure to disclose to the parties\'92 and the condo board that she, herself, is a not only a resident in the building, but the Vice President of the Homeowners\'92 Association. Knowing the parties\'92 situation as the acting listing/seller\'92s agent, she continued to issue demands in her capacity as an Association board member for past due association fees and dues, including threatening legal action. Additionally, the property sat active for over 200 days without a single offer. An obvious indication the listing was outrageously overpriced. Due to the various issues, leaving my client distrusting of this individual to represent either party\'92s best interest, he discussed with your client the intention to disengage with this person. You stated yourself that your client received \'93multiple emails\'94 so, it can be assumed that this change is not a shock to her. In fact, your client is in sole operation of the email account directly associated with the condo and its management. \'a0\
\'a0\
Your client continues to take what she can from Mr. Boerner with no intention of reaching resolution. Her so-called proposals are insulting to my client and his current situation. Again, I must waste time correcting your client\'92s representations to you regarding my client \'93living\'94 at the property. My client has spent a total of 8 nights at the property since it\'92s vacancy in October 2024. Of those 8 nights, 2 of them were for his own reasoning; with the remainder being for various needs, repairs, service visits, and general upkeep of the property. Your client has been aware since late September 2024 that my client\'92s resources were quickly depleting and by March 2025, he would no longer have the resources to financially maintain the property. \
\'a0\
Each day your client refuses to sign the listing agreement is another day the condo remains off market.\'a0 \
\'a0\
Given the above and the current market temperature, I would expect this issue will be resolved very soon. \
\'a0\
Thank you.\'a0 \

Maria: I am sending you one of many emails my client has received regarding the sale of the condo. As a result of the emails and actions of your client the Relator is no longer the listing agent and your client has unilaterally secured a new Realtor and wants the condo price reduced significantly. He also says he is no longer paying the mortgage beginning this month even though your client has been living at the condo. Please let me know if you are free to speak today to discuss this issue.

Assuming you mean next Wednesday, the 18th. 1pm works on the 18th. Are you calling me? That is my preference. Calling from 267-312-1810? Just in case you call from your office line, I may ignore it; I get so much spam from 267, 215, and 610, and I have an app that filters out calls, so I don\'92t even see them. I have your cell saved, so it will come through.\
\'a0\
As for the answer to the response, I guess I don\'92t see why it took that long to just refuse everything. It's been about 2 months? We can discuss it next week. Please confirm the calling day and time. I have it on my calendar; no need for an invite.

Hi Maria and Randi, checking if you received the below 6 days back. I\'92d like to set up a call for early to mid next week if possible. By then we should have Melissa\'92s financials as this Friday was her deadline. Correct me if I\'92m wrong. I would like to present the terms of our positioning from my side of the family more clearly. I\'92m flexible please feel free to pick a 20-30 minute time slot that works for you.\'a0\

To be blunt, \'a0I know she\'92s starting from zero and to be even more blunt\'85 I know she\'92s working because she reactivated her nursing license on September 3, 2024 per the public records I can see\
\'a0\
\'a0I don\'92t have any real interest in seeking alimony or any financial gain unless you can point a specific dollars or strategy I am emotionally leaving on the table, which I am rationally open to hearing about.\
\'a0\
And to be even more blunt she basically told me in so many wordsto go F myself in the one instance, I softly brought up the concept of sharing in Expenses that we carry forward together, \'85\
\'a0\
(especially the Mortgage for the Philadelphia condo property we bought during our marriage that has been on the market for 140 days. Add further this property is now on month three of mortgage owed without tenants to offset - so I have been paying all the utilities and mortgage, HOA dues of $750/month, etc on my own )\
\'a0\
Ive also had multiple financial blows since we last spoke (Our landlord from Florida was supposed to return a $4500 security deposit, but has broken every rule in the book deciding to keep it for himself so I am now suing him and going out of pocket with massive effort and cost - and not to go on and on but belongings I left at a friend\'92s house in Florida such as a $6000 golf cart that was for sale was all swept away by the hurricanes after I left roughly $12,000 worth of belongings )\
\'a0\
And since I didn\'92t have my car because she took it, the cost of moving my belongings and renting a sizable enough vehicle to get it all the way back up north was very costly\
\'a0\
I sold off all of my cryptocurrency (her lawyer\'92s email specify this because Melissa knows how important that was to me, but it is all gone), along with having sold physical metals\
\'a0\
and outside of a sheepish 401(k) and some private shares I bought as an accredited investor several years ago (that I very much do not want to let go of pre-IPO) there isn\'92t much to put on paper for her to take\
\'a0\
And\'a0a jeep grand Cherokee I bought before our marriage started so I think that technically won\'92t count towards the pie)\
\'a0\
That all said,\'a0I am down to dollars and cents, but remain debt free minus the mortgage.\'a0\
\'a0\
I haven\'92t pursued a W-2 income in fear. I would jeopardize her taking a portion of that and I\'92m staying with my parents in Rock Hall , Maryland.\'a0\
\'a0\
My parents, where is I call them humbly \'93my \'a0roommates\'94 have come to the table (along with one other investor) and pitched me the idea of buying out Melissa from the currently for sale condo property we own in Philadelphia that continues to have lackluster showings and drop after drop in price.\'a0\
\'a0\
The offer we came up with is a flat $20,000.\'a0\
\'a0\
If we couple that offer with showing enough of my financials to illustrate the above details and we show that I\'92ve paid 95% of all costs from the initial down payment and closing cost all the way through to the recurring bills she doesn\'92t even think of let alone pay Then I could whittle her 50% equity amount down to a number below 20,000.\'a0\
\'a0\
Our principle is $347,000 give or take and the purchase price was 400,000 so the equity is not high assuming an appraisal would come in around 400 which I\'92m confident it would even though it\'92s listed at 435,000 currently.\'a0\
\'a0\
If\'a0Pennsylvania starts us at 50% equally in terms of equity but allows consideration for who paid what after the fact and considering she\'92s not paying the $3300 per month of fixed mortgage plus HOA dues plus utilities to keep the lights on that I am paying on our mutual behalf then $20,000 should look good.\'a0\
\'a0\
We want to form an LLC and retain the property and the two private parking spots on an adjacent property that are likely worth more than the condo itself assuming the lot sells like many of the neighboring lots have sold in old city.\'a0\
\'a0\
I\'92ll spare you the strategy but we would transfer the title from Melissa and myself to an LLC with my two parents and one other investor plus myself so we would have to afford the transfer fees of $9000 or so but everyone has agreed\
\'a0\
Instead of spending the time of fruitlessly uploading documents for the sake of uploading documents, I thought I would put this idea here for you to ruminate and guide me on providing the most value towards this proposal without spinning my wheels on efforts that would go wasted otherwise\

Error! Filename not specified.\
Maria,\'a0\
\'a0\
After discussing with my family, we\'92re interested in exploring the possibility of buying out Melissa\'92s share of the Philadelphia condo we purchased during our marriage. I\'92d like your input on whether it would be appropriate for you to make an offer on my behalf to her lawyer and, ultimately, to Melissa.\
\'a0\
Our goal in pursuing this route is to streamline the process, avoid the complexities of discovery, and step away from any contentious stances, including potential alimony disputes. If there is resistance or we anticipate any, I believe additional discovery into the condo\'92s funding could demonstrate that I covered 99 percent of the expenses, potentially impacting her entitlement to a full 50 percent of the current equity.\
\'a0\
Should we move forward, we\'92d need a proper appraisal and extend her the opportunity to get an independent appraisal as well, establishing the current equity.\'a0\
\'a0\
Additionally, I plan to create an LLC specifically for the purpose of transferring ownership. I\'92m aware that transfer taxes in Philadelphia are significant, but I have compelling reasons to retain ownership, which I\'92d be happy to discuss during a brief call. Also, to avoid taxes elsewhere this would be completely at the start of the new year but preferably offered and potentially agreed upon sooner than later so we could remove the condo from the for sale market\'a0\
\'a0\
I\'92m available at any time this week, so please let me know a convenient time for us to talk, or feel free to call me directly.\

Maria, I have yet to turn in my financials to you but we are yet to receive Melissa\'92s correct?\
\'a0\
I ask because my parents and I have aligned on a buyout proposal. We can couple it with the financial snapshot to justify the buyout proposal and ultimately a proposal to conclude the marriage formally without any more delay.\'a0\
\uc0\u8232 \u8232 \
What is the best method to move forward and introduce you to the details of the condo buyout.\'a0\

Error! Filename not specified.\
Maria,\'a0\
\'a0\
After discussing with my family, we\'92re interested in exploring the possibility of buying out Melissa\'92s share of the Philadelphia condo we purchased during our marriage. I\'92d like your input on whether it would be appropriate for you to make an offer on my behalf to her lawyer and, ultimately, to Melissa.\
\'a0\
Our goal in pursuing this route is to streamline the process, avoid the complexities of discovery, and step away from any contentious stances, including potential alimony disputes. If there is resistance or we anticipate any, I believe additional discovery into the condo\'92s funding could demonstrate that I covered 99 percent of the expenses, potentially impacting her entitlement to a full 50 percent of the current equity.\
\'a0\
Should we move forward, we\'92d need a proper appraisal and extend her the opportunity to get an independent appraisal as well, establishing the current equity.\'a0\
\'a0\
Additionally, I plan to create an LLC specifically for the purpose of transferring ownership. I\'92m aware that transfer taxes in Philadelphia are significant, but I have compelling reasons to retain ownership, which I\'92d be happy to discuss during a brief call. Also, to avoid taxes elsewhere this would be completely at the start of the new year but preferably offered and potentially agreed upon sooner than later so we could remove the condo from the for sale market\'a0\
\'a0\
I\'92m available at any time this week, so please let me know a convenient time for us to talk, or feel free to call me directly.\

How are you?\
\'a0\
I received the attached letter from her counsel.\
\'a0\
I will be sending formal discovery to her counsel this week, which is a formal request for documents and responses to questions.\'a0 She will have 30 days to respond.\
\'a0\
All documents are really needed to move the divorce along. So, if you could, please work on gathering the requested documents for me to review.\'a0 \

\'95 Could you please share a copy of our legal response to Melissa\'92s initial divorce filing (our Answer and any Counterclaims)? I\'92d like to review it for my records.\
Hi, it is the same document I sent to you for review prior to filing!\'a0 The time-stamped version is attached or your records.\'a0 \
\'a0\
\'a0\
\'a0\
\'a0\
\'a0\
\'a0\
\'a0\
\'a0\
\'a0\
\'95 I understand the ball is in her court now. Could you provide an estimated timeline for their response? This would help me mentally prepare for this phase and alleviate some stress during the waiting period.\
\'a0\
\'a0\
\'a0\
\'a0\
\'a0They do not need to file a response; you did an Answer to her divorce.\'a0 The next thing is to do discovery; the request for documents.\'a0 Once requested, there is a 30 day period for which to provide them. \

Communication via Lawyer\
\'a0\
\'a0\
\'a0\
\'a0\
\'a0\
\'a0\
\'a0\
\'a0\
\'a0\
\'95 Melissa has demanded that I cease all direct communication with her and route all interactions through her lawyer.\
\'a0\
\'a0\
\'a0\
\'a0\
\'a0That is unreasonable and unnecessarily costly.\'a0 You have no obligation to adhere to that demand. \
\'a0\
\'a0\
\'a0\
\'a0\
\'95 Initially, we agreed to work together amicably to close out accounts and address loose ends, but this has changed.\
\'a0\
\'a0\

Verizon Account\
\'a0\
\'a0\
\'a0\
\'a0\
\'a0\
\'a0\
\'a0\
\'a0\
\'a0\
\'95 Melissa, as the primary holder of our joint Verizon Wireless account, initiated splitting the account.\
\'a0\
\'a0\
\'a0\
\'a0\
\'95 I assisted by joining the call with Verizon and providing any necessary two-factor authentication codes, fulfilling our prior agreement.\

PECO Energy Account and Condo Preparations\
\'a0\
\'a0\
\'a0\
\'a0\
\'a0\
\'a0\
\'a0\
\'a0\
\'a0\
\'95 Our tenants moved out at the end of September from our jointly owned condo.\
\'a0\
\'a0\
\'a0\
\'a0\
\'95 I transferred the PECO energy account into my name to ensure we have power for open houses and showings.\
\'a0\
\'a0\
\'a0\
\'a0\
\'95 Melissa delayed providing a two-factor authentication code needed for the transfer, resulting in about a week without power at the condo, which hindered repair work and preparations.\
\'a0\
\'a0\
\'a0\
\'a0\
\'95 She eventually provided the necessary information, but the delay caused significant inconvenience.\

Access to Joint Gmail Account\
\'a0\
\'a0\
\'a0\
\'a0\
\'a0\
\'a0\
\'a0\
\'a0\
\'a0\
\'95 We have a joint Gmail account (stephenandmelissaboerner@gmail.com) used for shared utilities and subscriptions.\
\'a0\
\'a0\
\'a0\
\'a0\
\'95 Melissa set up the account through her phone, and I cannot access it without a two-factor authentication code sent to her device.\
\'a0\
\'a0\
\'a0\
\'a0\
\'95 She has ignored multiple requests to grant me access to this mutually owned account.\
\'a0\
\'a0\
\'a0\
\'a0\
\'95 Since she insists on all communication going through her lawyer, I\'92m unable to resolve this directly with her.\

Mortgage and HOA Contributions\
\'a0\
\'a0\
\'a0\
\'a0\
\'95 Melissa has decided not to contribute to the monthly mortgage payments starting October 2024\'97the first month without tenants in our condo.\
\'a0\
\'a0\
\'a0\
\'a0\
\'95 The monthly mortgage is approximately $2,400, including around $530 in escrow for Philadelphia property taxes.\
\'a0\
\'a0\
\'a0\
\'a0\
\'95 Additionally, there are HOA dues of approximately $800 per month.\
\'a0\
\'a0\
\'a0\
\'a0\
\'95 I have made the October mortgage and HOA payments in full without any contribution from her.\
\'a0\
\'a0\
\'a0\
\'a0\
\'95 Back on July 17, 2024, she stated in a text message that she expects a fair split of the condo proceeds, yet currently, I\'92m shouldering all the expenses.\
\'a0\
\'a0\
\'a0\

Financial Strain and Impact on Business\
\'a0\
\'a0\
\'a0\
\'a0\
\'95 Covering these expenses alone is depleting my cash reserves.\
\'a0\
\'a0\
\'a0\
\'a0\
\'95 This financial strain is significantly hindering my ability to focus on my startup and generate revenue.\
\'a0\

Questions and Requests\
\'a0\
\'a0\
\'a0\
\'a0\
\'a0\
\'a0\
\'a0\
1.\
Documentation Guidance\
\'a0\
\'a0\
\'a0\
\'95 To what extent should I be documenting these financial contributions and communication issues?\
\'a0\
\'a0\
The condo was not used as the marital residence, so you will have an argument for a credit for what you paid.\'a0 But, if it is too much, then perhaps listing it for sale makes sense?\'a0 \
\'a0\
I would like proof of payments you make towards the condo, so we have it for the credit request.\'a0 \
\'a0\
\'a0\
\'95 Should I include these expenses in the financial summary in response to what they will send us, given that I am currently covering these payments alone?\
\'a0\
\'a0\
Yes, you should.\'a0 \
\'a0\
\'a0\
2. Joint Gmail Account Access\
\'a0\
\'a0\
\'a0\
\'a0\
\'95 Is there any action we can take regarding Melissa\'92s refusal to share access to our joint Gmail account? This hinders my ability to manage our shared responsibilities.\
\'a0\
\'a0Yes, we can certainly request the information.\'a0 Or, since you are managing the property, you could create a new email address that she cannot use.\'a0 Is that an option?\'a0 \
\'a0\
\'a0\
3. Shared Expenses\
\'a0\
\'a0\
\'a0\
\'a0\
\'95 What can be done about Melissa\'92s lack of contribution to shared expenses, given our mutual ownership of the property?\
\'a0\
\'a0You are divorcing and you did not reside in this residence, so there is no presumption you should share the expenses.\'a0 Therefore, most people would either re-rent the property or list it for sale.\'a0 She cannot be forced to share in these expenses.\'a0 \
\'a0\
\'a0\
4. Relevance of Attachments\
\'a0\
\'a0\
\'a0\
\'a0\
\'95 Please advise if the attached screenshots will be relevant in the broader scheme of things.\
\'a0\
\'a0\
\'a0\
\'a0They are relevant to show she would not pay for the condo.\'a0 I don\'92t think the fact that she won\'92t communicate with you other than through attorney\'92s is needed other than to show she won\'92t do it.\'a0 \
\'a0\
\'a0\
\'a0\
Thank you for your assistance. I appreciate your guidance on these matters and look forward to your response.\

Maria,\
\'a0\
I\'92ve been struggling to decide what the best course of action is. I think it would be helpful if we could talk about this further. I\'92m available via my cell phone today, but I\'92m also traveling and have flight details below.\
\'a0\
Tomorrow might be a better time to talk, but I\'92d like to find a way to speak as soon as possible. I\'92m trying to be flexible and can make time today.\
\'a0\
One important point is that she wants me to pay for her expensive lawyer at the end of this. However, I\'92ve already spent thousands of dollars on car rental and transportation services for myself and my service dog, who supports my PTSD. The PTSD was triggered by a home invasion in Gulfport, Florida, on March 26, 2024, when I had a physical altercation with an intruder in our home while trying to protect our family.\
\'a0\
As of this morning, Friday, September 13, 2024, and almost two months since she took the Jeep with the intention of keeping it, I\'92ll be picking it up and taking it to a service station so McKenna can fix the wear and tear that has accumulated during her cross-country drives since then.\
\'a0\
I\'92ve had to rent almost four cars to make ends meet, and I also had to rent a large moving SUV that cost over $2000 to move her belongings and mine out of the home we rented together in Gulfport, Florida. She left me alone to handle all of this on my own.\

As of this morning, I\'92ve arrived in the northeast with the belongings I could salvage and my service dog. We have a place to stay in Austin, Texas, until October 6, 2024, when I\'92ll return to the Philadelphia area. At that time, I\'92ll collect the Jeep that\'92s going to be serviced while I\'92m away and drive it to Rock Hall, Maryland.\
\'a0\
My parents have kindly allowed me to use their mostly vacant retirement condo as my next residential address and mailing address. I\'92ve provided that address below, and it will serve as my mailing address moving forward. Please don\'92t send any mail to my previously leased in Gulfport, Florida.\

Maria,\
\'a0\
I\'92ve been struggling to decide what the best course of action is. I think it would be helpful if we could talk about this further. I\'92m available via my cell phone today, but I\'92m also traveling and have flight details below.\
\'a0\
Tomorrow might be a better time to talk, but I\'92d like to find a way to speak as soon as possible. I\'92m trying to be flexible and can make time today.\
\'a0\
One important point is that she wants me to pay for her expensive lawyer at the end of this. However, I\'92ve already spent thousands of dollars on car rental and transportation services for myself and my service dog, who supports my PTSD. The PTSD was triggered by a home invasion in Gulfport, Florida, on March 26, 2024, when I had a physical altercation with an intruder in our home while trying to protect our family.\
\'a0\
As of this morning, Friday, September 13, 2024, and almost two months since she took the Jeep with the intention of keeping it, I\'92ll be picking it up and taking it to a service station so McKenna can fix the wear and tear that has accumulated during her cross-country drives since then.\
\'a0\
I\'92ve had to rent almost four cars to make ends meet, and I also had to rent a large moving SUV that cost over $2000 to move her belongings and mine out of the home we rented together in Gulfport, Florida. She left me alone to handle all of this on my own.\
\'a0\
As of this morning, I\'92ve arrived in the northeast with the belongings I could salvage and my service dog. We have a place to stay in Austin, Texas, until October 6, 2024, when I\'92ll return to the Philadelphia area. At that time, I\'92ll collect the Jeep that\'92s going to be serviced while I\'92m away and drive it to Rock Hall, Maryland.\
\'a0\
My parents have kindly allowed me to use their mostly vacant retirement condo as my next residential address and mailing address. I\'92ve provided that address below, and it will serve as my mailing address moving forward. Please don\'92t send any mail to my previously leased in Gulfport, Florida.\

I plan to change my registered residential address in early October. Between now and then, I will be spending time in Austin, Texas. I will be in Austin (and on Central Time) from September 9th to October 6th.\'a0\
\'a0\
At that time, I fly to Rock Hall, Maryland, at which point I will register for a Driver's License change in residential address and shift from a Floridian to a state of Maryland resident until I get through this divorce. Thank you.\'a0\

Information Sheet: Your version wasn't possible to fill out. The DOB field\'a0was about a 2 in terms of font size and a very frustrating form, so I found an identical form that\'a0allowed me to fill it out. It has the same content as yours. I'm unsure if that's an issue. Let me know. I could not locate Melissa's social security number. I used to have it but can't find it.\'a0\
	\'95	Also, for the employment section, I don't know if what I put was optimal for my situation, as I explained. As an entrepreneur in the\'a0startup phase, I'm unsure how the courts will view this and how to fill out forms like this. I'll look for your guidance.\'a0\
\'a0\
- Verification form - added my name, signature, and date. I should be good on this one.\'a0\

Maria,\
\'a0\
I\'92ve been struggling to decide what the best course of action is. I think it would be helpful if we could talk about this further. I\'92m available via my cell phone today, but I\'92m also traveling and have flight details below.\
\'a0\
Tomorrow might be a better time to talk, but I\'92d like to find a way to speak as soon as possible. I\'92m trying to be flexible and can make time today.\
\'a0\
One important point is that she wants me to pay for her expensive lawyer at the end of this. However, I\'92ve already spent thousands of dollars on car rental and transportation services for myself and my service dog, who supports my PTSD. The PTSD was triggered by a home invasion in Gulfport, Florida, on March 26, 2024, when I had a physical altercation with an intruder in our home while trying to protect our family.\
\'a0\
As of this morning, Friday, September 13, 2024, and almost two months since she took the Jeep with the intention of keeping it, I\'92ll be picking it up and taking it to a service station so McKenna can fix the wear and tear that has accumulated during her cross-country drives since then.\
\'a0\
I\'92ve had to rent almost four cars to make ends meet, and I also had to rent a large moving SUV that cost over $2000 to move her belongings and mine out of the home we rented together in Gulfport, Florida. She left me alone to handle all of this on my own.\
\'a0\
As of this morning, I\'92ve arrived in the northeast with the belongings I could salvage and my service dog. We have a place to stay in Austin, Texas, until October 6, 2024, when I\'92ll return to the Philadelphia area. At that time, I\'92ll collect the Jeep that\'92s going to be serviced while I\'92m away and drive it to Rock Hall, Maryland.\
\'a0\
My parents have kindly allowed me to use their mostly vacant retirement condo as my next residential address and mailing address. I\'92ve provided that address below, and it will serve as my mailing address moving forward. Please don\'92t send any mail to my previously leased in Gulfport, Florida.\

With all that said, I just don\'92t know how to interpret the request for support and what that means related to the divorce as a whole you mention that her filing excluded, a deeper dive into everything that I own, but I don\'92t quite recall. It was something that you were surprised she left out\'a0\
\'a0\
Anyway I would like to talk through this before making such a pivotal decision.\

Attached is the drafted Answer and Counterclaim.\
\'a0\
For the counter-claim, I highlighted the two counts I was not sure you wanted to include.\'a0 We discussed her ability to work and that you are between jobs (start-up and no paycheck since 12.23), but I didn\'92t think you wanted to file for support.\'a0 I put them in there and can remove them.\

Please read my last email and take a look at the three attachments.\'a0\
\'a0\
I'm sending this second email to correct a mistake in one of those three attachments. Please ignore the form information sheet I provided you in the first email. The form information sheet had errors, as I sent you an address with typos and missed a few fields. I've corrected the form and reattached it to this second email.\
\'a0\
I plan to change my registered residential address in early October. Between now and then, I will be spending time in Austin, Texas. I will be in Austin (and on Central Time) from September 9th to October 6th.\'a0\
\'a0\
At that time, I fly to Rock Hall, Maryland, at which point I will register for a Driver's License change in residential address and shift from a Floridian to a state of Maryland resident until I get through this divorce. Thank you.\'a0\

Maria,\
\'a0\
I\'92ve been struggling to decide what the best course of action is. I think it would be helpful if we could talk about this further. I\'92m available via my cell phone today, but I\'92m also traveling and have flight details below.\
\'a0\
Tomorrow might be a better time to talk, but I\'92d like to find a way to speak as soon as possible. I\'92m trying to be flexible and can make time today.\
\'a0\
One important point is that she wants me to pay for her expensive lawyer at the end of this. However, I\'92ve already spent thousands of dollars on car rental and transportation services for myself and my service dog, who supports my PTSD. The PTSD was triggered by a home invasion in Gulfport, Florida, on March 26, 2024, when I had a physical altercation with an intruder in our home while trying to protect our family.\
\'a0\
As of this morning, Friday, September 13, 2024, and almost two months since she took the Jeep with the intention of keeping it, I\'92ll be picking it up and taking it to a service station so McKenna can fix the wear and tear that has accumulated during her cross-country drives since then.\
\'a0\
I\'92ve had to rent almost four cars to make ends meet, and I also had to rent a large moving SUV that cost over $2000 to move her belongings and mine out of the home we rented together in Gulfport, Florida. She left me alone to handle all of this on my own.\
\'a0\
As of this morning, I\'92ve arrived in the northeast with the belongings I could salvage and my service dog. We have a place to stay in Austin, Texas, until October 6, 2024, when I\'92ll return to the Philadelphia area. At that time, I\'92ll collect the Jeep that\'92s going to be serviced while I\'92m away and drive it to Rock Hall, Maryland.\
\'a0\
My parents have kindly allowed me to use their mostly vacant retirement condo as my next residential address and mailing address. I\'92ve provided that address below, and it will serve as my mailing address moving forward. Please don\'92t send any mail to my previously leased in Gulfport, Florida.\

With all that said, I just don\'92t know how to interpret the request for support and what that means related to the divorce as a whole you mention that her filing excluded, a deeper dive into everything that I own, but I don\'92t quite recall. It was something that you were surprised she left out\'a0\
\'a0\
Anyway I would like to talk through this before making such a pivotal decision.\
\'a0\

Hi,\
\'a0\
Attached is the drafted Answer and Counterclaim.\
\'a0\
For the counter-claim, I highlighted the two counts I was not sure you wanted to include.\'a0 We discussed her ability to work and that you are between jobs (start-up and no paycheck since 12.23), but I didn\'92t think you wanted to file for support.\'a0 I put them in there and can remove them.\

Maria,\'a0\
\'a0\
Please read my last email and take a look at the three attachments.\'a0\
\'a0\
I'm sending this second email to correct a mistake in one of those three attachments. Please ignore the form information sheet I provided you in the first email. The form information sheet had errors, as I sent you an address with typos and missed a few fields. I've corrected the form and reattached it to this second email.\
\'a0\
I plan to change my registered residential address in early October. Between now and then, I will be spending time in Austin, Texas. I will be in Austin (and on Central Time) from September 9th to October 6th.\'a0\
\'a0\
At that time, I fly to Rock Hall, Maryland, at which point I will register for a Driver's License change in residential address and shift from a Floridian to a state of Maryland resident until I get through this divorce. Thank you.\'a0\

See the attached revised version.\'a0\

Maria,\
\'a0\
I\'92ve been struggling to decide what the best course of action is. I think it would be helpful if we could talk about this further. I\'92m available via my cell phone today, but I\'92m also traveling and have flight details below.\
\'a0\
Tomorrow might be a better time to talk, but I\'92d like to find a way to speak as soon as possible. I\'92m trying to be flexible and can make time today.\
\'a0\
One important point is that she wants me to pay for her expensive lawyer at the end of this. However, I\'92ve already spent thousands of dollars on car rental and transportation services for myself and my service dog, who supports my PTSD. The PTSD was triggered by a home invasion in Gulfport, Florida, on March 26, 2024, when I had a physical altercation with an intruder in our home while trying to protect our family.\
\'a0\
As of this morning, Friday, September 13, 2024, and almost two months since she took the Jeep with the intention of keeping it, I\'92ll be picking it up and taking it to a service station so McKenna can fix the wear and tear that has accumulated during her cross-country drives since then.\
\'a0\
I\'92ve had to rent almost four cars to make ends meet, and I also had to rent a large moving SUV that cost over $2000 to move her belongings and mine out of the home we rented together in Gulfport, Florida. She left me alone to handle all of this on my own.\
\'a0\
As of this morning, I\'92ve arrived in the northeast with the belongings I could salvage and my service dog. We have a place to stay in Austin, Texas, until October 6, 2024, when I\'92ll return to the Philadelphia area. At that time, I\'92ll collect the Jeep that\'92s going to be serviced while I\'92m away and drive it to Rock Hall, Maryland.\
\'a0\
My parents have kindly allowed me to use their mostly vacant retirement condo as my next residential address and mailing address. I\'92ve provided that address below, and it will serve as my mailing address moving forward. Please don\'92t send any mail to my previously leased in Gulfport, Florida.\

\'a0\
With all that said, I just don\'92t know how to interpret the request for support and what that means related to the divorce as a whole you mention that her filing excluded, a deeper dive into everything that I own, but I don\'92t quite recall. It was something that you were surprised she left out\'a0\
\'a0\
Anyway I would like to talk through this before making such a pivotal decision.\
\'a0\

Hi,\
\'a0\
Attached is the drafted Answer and Counterclaim.\
\'a0\
For the counter-claim, I highlighted the two counts I was not sure you wanted to include.\'a0 We discussed her ability to work and that you are between jobs (start-up and no paycheck since 12.23), but I didn\'92t think you wanted to file for support.\'a0 I put them in there and can remove them.\
\'a0\
Otherwise, let me know if other changes are needed!\'a0 If not, confirm I can file!\'a0 \

Maria,\'a0\
\'a0\
Please read my last email and take a look at the three attachments.\'a0\
\'a0\
I'm sending this second email to correct a mistake in one of those three attachments. Please ignore the form information sheet I provided you in the first email. The form information sheet had errors, as I sent you an address with typos and missed a few fields. I've corrected the form and reattached it to this second email.\
\'a0\
I plan to change my registered residential address in early October. Between now and then, I will be spending time in Austin, Texas. I will be in Austin (and on Central Time) from September 9th to October 6th.\'a0\
\'a0\
At that time, I fly to Rock Hall, Maryland, at which point I will register for a Driver's License change in residential address and shift from a Floridian to a state of Maryland resident until I get through this divorce. Thank you.\'a0\
\'a0\
See the attached revised version.\'a0\

Information Sheet: Your version wasn't possible to fill out.

Maria,\
\'a0\
I\'92ve been struggling to decide what the best course of action is. I think it would be helpful if we could talk about this further. I\'92m available via my cell phone today, but I\'92m also traveling and have flight details below.\
\'a0\
Tomorrow might be a better time to talk, but I\'92d like to find a way to speak as soon as possible. I\'92m trying to be flexible and can make time today.\
\'a0\
One important point is that she wants me to pay for her expensive lawyer at the end of this. However, I\'92ve already spent thousands of dollars on car rental and transportation services for myself and my service dog, who supports my PTSD. The PTSD was triggered by a home invasion in Gulfport, Florida, on March 26, 2024, when I had a physical altercation with an intruder in our home while trying to protect our family.\
\'a0\
As of this morning, Friday, September 13, 2024, and almost two months since she took the Jeep with the intention of keeping it, I\'92ll be picking it up and taking it to a service station so McKenna can fix the wear and tear that has accumulated during her cross-country drives since then.\
\'a0\
I\'92ve had to rent almost four cars to make ends meet, and I also had to rent a large moving SUV that cost over $2000 to move her belongings and mine out of the home we rented together in Gulfport, Florida. She left me alone to handle all of this on my own.\
\'a0\
As of this morning, I\'92ve arrived in the northeast with the belongings I could salvage and my service dog. We have a place to stay in Austin, Texas, until October 6, 2024, when I\'92ll return to the Philadelphia area. At that time, I\'92ll collect the Jeep that\'92s going to be serviced while I\'92m away and drive it to Rock Hall, Maryland.\
\'a0\
My parents have kindly allowed me to use their mostly vacant retirement condo as my next residential address and mailing address. I\'92ve provided that address below, and it will serve as my mailing address moving forward. Please don\'92t send any mail to my previously leased in Gulfport, Florida.\

With all that said, I just don\'92t know how to interpret the request for support and what that means related to the divorce as a whole you mention that her filing excluded, a deeper dive into everything that I own, but I don\'92t quite recall. It was something that you were surprised she left out\'a0\
\'a0\
Anyway I would like to talk through this before making such a pivotal decision.\

Hi,\
\'a0\
Attached is the drafted Answer and Counterclaim.\
\'a0\
For the counter-claim, I highlighted the two counts I was not sure you wanted to include.\'a0 We discussed her ability to work and that you are between jobs (start-up and no paycheck since 12.23), but I didn\'92t think you wanted to file for support.\'a0 I put them in there and can remove them.\
\'a0\
Otherwise, let me know if other changes are needed!\'a0 If not, confirm I can file!\'a0 \

Maria,\'a0\
\'a0\
Please read my last email and take a look at the three attachments.\'a0\
\'a0\
I'm sending this second email to correct a mistake in one of those three attachments. Please ignore the form information sheet I provided you in the first email. The form information sheet had errors, as I sent you an address with typos and missed a few fields. I've corrected the form and reattached it to this second email.\
\'a0\
I plan to change my registered residential address in early October. Between now and then, I will be spending time in Austin, Texas. I will be in Austin (and on Central Time) from September 9th to October 6th.\'a0\
\'a0\
At that time, I fly to Rock Hall, Maryland, at which point I will register for a Driver's License change in residential address and shift from a Floridian to a state of Maryland resident until I get through this divorce. Thank you.\'a0\
\'a0\
See the attached revised version.\'a0\

Maria,\
\
I\'92ve been struggling to decide what the best course of action is. I think it would be helpful if we could talk about this further. I\'92m available via my cell phone today, but I\'92m also traveling and have flight details below.\
\
Tomorrow might be a better time to talk, but I\'92d like to find a way to speak as soon as possible. I\'92m trying to be flexible and can make time today.\
\
One important point is that she wants me to pay for her expensive lawyer at the end of this. However, I\'92ve already spent thousands of dollars on car rental and transportation services for myself and my service dog, who supports my PTSD. The PTSD was triggered by a home invasion in Gulfport, Florida, on March 26, 2024, when I had a physical altercation with an intruder in our home while trying to protect our family.\
\
As of this morning, Friday, September 13, 2024, and almost two months since she took the Jeep with the intention of keeping it, I\'92ll be picking it up and taking it to a service station so McKenna can fix the wear and tear that has accumulated during her cross-country drives since then.\
\
I\'92ve had to rent almost four cars to make ends meet, and I also had to rent a large moving SUV that cost over $2000 to move her belongings and mine out of the home we rented together in Gulfport, Florida. She left me alone to handle all of this on my own.\
\
As of this morning, I\'92ve arrived in the northeast with the belongings I could salvage and my service dog. We have a place to stay in Austin, Texas, until October 6, 2024, when I\'92ll return to the Philadelphia area. At that time, I\'92ll collect the Jeep that\'92s going to be serviced while I\'92m away and drive it to Rock Hall, Maryland.\
\
My parents have kindly allowed me to use their mostly vacant retirement condo as my next residential address and mailing address. I\'92ve provided that address below, and it will serve as my mailing address moving forward. Please don\'92t send any mail to my previously leased in Gulfport, Florida.\

With all that said, I just don\'92t know how to interpret the request for support and what that means related to the divorce as a whole you mention that her filing excluded, a deeper dive into everything that I own, but I don\'92t quite recall. It was something that you were surprised she left out\'a0\
\
Anyway I would like to talk through this before making such a pivotal decision.\

Please read my last email and take a look at the three attachments.\'a0\
\'a0\
I'm sending this second email to correct a mistake in one of those three attachments. Please ignore the form information sheet I provided you in the first email. The form information sheet had errors, as I sent you an address with typos and missed a few fields. I've corrected the form and reattached it to this second email.\
\'a0\
I plan to change my registered residential address in early October. Between now and then, I will be spending time in Austin, Texas. I will be in Austin (and on Central Time) from September 9th to October 6th.\'a0\
\'a0\
At that time, I fly to Rock Hall, Maryland, at which point I will register for a Driver's License change in residential address and shift from a Floridian to a state of Maryland resident until I get through this divorce. Thank you.\'a0\

Hi,\
\'a0\
Attached is the drafted Answer and Counterclaim.\
\'a0\
For the counter-claim, I highlighted the two counts I was not sure you wanted to include.\'a0 We discussed her ability to work and that you are between jobs (start-up and no paycheck since 12.23), but I didn\'92t think you wanted to file for support.\'a0 I put them in there and can remove them.\
\'a0\
Otherwise, let me know if other changes are needed!\'a0 If not, confirm I can file!\'a0 \
\'a0\

Maria,\'a0\
\'a0\
Please read my last email and take a look at the three attachments.\'a0\
\'a0\
I'm sending this second email to correct a mistake in one of those three attachments. Please ignore the form information sheet I provided you in the first email. The form information sheet had errors, as I sent you an address with typos and missed a few fields. I've corrected the form and reattached it to this second email.\
\'a0\
I plan to change my registered residential address in early October. Between now and then, I will be spending time in Austin, Texas. I will be in Austin (and on Central Time) from September 9th to October 6th.\'a0\
\'a0\
At that time, I fly to Rock Hall, Maryland, at which point I will register for a Driver's License change in residential address and shift from a Floridian to a state of Maryland resident until I get through this divorce. Thank you.\'a0\
\'a0\
See the attached revised version.\'a0\
