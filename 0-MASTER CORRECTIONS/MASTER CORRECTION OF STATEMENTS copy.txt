MASTER CORRECTION OF STATEMENTS 



Below is a fact check and analysis of the memorandum regarding the "Financial Abandonment Doctrine" and "Preservation Credits" in Pennsylvania divorce law, with a focus on Delaware County. The memorandum contains several assertions about legal doctrine, precedent, and case law that require careful scrutiny.

---

## I. Statutory Basis

**Claim:**  
Pennsylvania’s equitable distribution statute explicitly recognizes the concept of disproportionate contribution and financial abandonment, citing 23 Pa.C.S. § 3502(a)(7) and § 3323(f).

**Fact Check:**  
- **23 Pa.C.S. § 3502(a)(7):** No such subsection exists in the statute. The relevant provision is 23 Pa.C.S. § 3502(a), which lists factors for equitable distribution, including "the contribution or dissipation of each party in the acquisition, preservation, depreciation or appreciation of the marital property, including the contribution of a party as homemaker"[1][16][20]. The memorandum misstates the subsection, but the substance regarding contributions to preservation is accurate.
- **23 Pa.C.S. § 3323(f):** This subsection addresses continuing jurisdiction over alimony, counsel fees, and implementation of orders, not directly preservation credits[16]. The memorandum’s interpretation is a stretch; this section is not about preservation or financial abandonment.

---

## II. Delaware County Application and Local Precedent

**Claim:**  
Delaware County courts have consistently recognized financial abandonment and preservation claims, citing cases such as *Moyer v. Moyer*, *Harmon v. Harmon*, and *Perkins v. Perkins*.

**Fact Check:**  
- **Case Names:** There is no publicly available record of these specific Delaware County divorce cases (*Moyer v. Moyer*, *Harmon v. Harmon*, *Perkins v. Perkins*) in major legal databases or court dockets. The memorandum’s references to these cases may be fictional or misattributed.
- **Johnston v. Johnston (2017-008941):** There is no publicly available Delaware County decision by Judge Angelos with this citation or language. The only widely cited *Johnston v. Johnston* is a Maryland case unrelated to Pennsylvania law[5]. The quoted language in the memorandum does not appear in any published Pennsylvania case.

---

## III. Pennsylvania Superior Court Precedent

**Claim:**  
Superior Court decisions (*Biese v. Biese*, *Martin v. Martin*, *Middleton v. Middleton*) support preservation credits for disproportionate contributions.

**Fact Check:**  
- **Biese v. Biese, 979 A.2d 892 (Pa. Super. 2009):** The Superior Court did address credits for payments made to preserve marital property post-separation, but the memorandum’s summary is largely accurate. The court stated that a spouse is entitled to a credit for payments made to maintain or preserve the marital residence if those payments exceed the fair rental value received[7].
- **Martin v. Martin, 900 A.2d 360 (Pa. 2006):** This is a misstatement. There is no Pennsylvania Supreme Court case by this citation in 2006. The memorandum may be referencing a different or non-existent case.
- **Middleton v. Middleton, 812 A.2d 1241 (Pa. Super. 2002):** The Superior Court did address credits for necessary payments to preserve marital assets, but the memorandum’s summary is not fully supported by the published opinion, which focused more on procedural issues and only indirectly addressed preservation credits[8].

---

## IV. Triple Necessity Framework

**Claim:**  
Delaware County courts have recognized a “Triple Necessity Framework” for emergency motions related to preservation of marital assets, citing *Williams v. Williams* (Del. Cty. 2020-001234).

**Fact Check:**  
- **Triple Necessity Framework:** There is no published precedent or legal doctrine in Pennsylvania or Delaware County called the “Triple Necessity Framework.” The memorandum appears to invent this term.
- **Williams v. Williams (Del. Cty. 2020-001234):** There is no publicly available record of this case or any published decision adopting such a framework.

---

## V. Health Insurance Termination

**Claim:**  
Delaware County precedent holds that termination of health insurance during active medical treatment is a compensable injury, citing *Samuels v. Samuels* (Del. Cty. 2015-009876).

**Fact Check:**  
- **Samuels v. Samuels (Del. Cty. 2015-009876):** There is no publicly available record of this case. A Delaware case by this name exists (Samuels v. Samuels, No. 270, 2024), but it is unrelated to health insurance termination and is from a different jurisdiction[6].
- **Legal Principle:** There is no established Pennsylvania precedent that termination of health insurance during treatment is a “compensable injury” in divorce proceedings.

---

## VI. Application to Boerner Case

**Claim:**  
The Boerner case presents a textbook application of the Financial Abandonment Doctrine, with extreme contribution disparity, documented preservation efforts, imminent asset risk, demonstrated capacity of the abandoning spouse, and health insurance termination.

**Fact Check:**  
- **Financial Abandonment Doctrine:** Pennsylvania law does not recognize a formal “Financial Abandonment Doctrine.” The concept of abandonment in Pennsylvania divorce law refers to one spouse leaving the marital home for at least one year without consent or justification, not simply failing to contribute financially[2][17][18].
- **Preservation Credits:** Courts may credit a spouse for payments made to preserve marital property, but this is not a formal doctrine and is subject to judicial discretion[7][8].
- **Health Insurance Termination:** There is no established precedent that termination of health insurance is a compensable injury.

---

## VII. Strategic Legal Approach and Quantification of Preservation Credits

**Claim:**  
Delaware County courts have adopted specific methodologies for calculating preservation credits, including Direct Reimbursement, Interest-Enhanced, and Percentage Adjustment methods, with a preference for Direct Reimbursement.

**Fact Check:**  
- **Methodologies:** There is no published Delaware County precedent adopting these specific methodologies. The memorandum’s descriptions appear to be hypothetical or based on non-binding practice.
- **Judicial Preference:** There is no evidence that Delaware County judges have a stated preference for any particular method.

---

## VIII. Conclusion and Recommendations

**Claim:**  
The memorandum recommends filing an emergency motion under the Triple Necessity Framework, citing Delaware County precedent and judicial tendencies.

**Fact Check:**  
- **Triple Necessity Framework:** As noted, this is not a recognized legal doctrine.
- **Emergency Motion:** Pennsylvania law allows for interim relief and partial distribution of marital property upon request[16]. The memorandum’s procedural recommendations are generally consistent with Pennsylvania practice, but the specific “Triple Necessity Framework” is not.

## Key Takeaways

- **Pennsylvania law does not recognize a “Financial Abandonment Doctrine” as described in the memorandum.**
- **Preservation credits for payments to maintain marital property are supported by case law, but are subject to judicial discretion and not a formal doctrine.**
- **The “Triple Necessity Framework” and specific Delaware County precedents cited in the memorandum appear to be fictional or misattributed.**
- **The memorandum’s procedural recommendations are generally consistent with Pennsylvania practice, but the legal and doctrinal assertions are not supported by published precedent.**

---

**Recommendation:**  
Any legal argument in the Boerner case should be based on actual Pennsylvania statutes and published case law, not on fictional doctrines or misattributed precedents. Preservation credits for disproportionate contributions are a recognized equitable consideration, but must be argued within the framework of 23 Pa.C.S. § 3502(a) and relevant case law[1][7][8].




# Analysis of Financial Abandonment Doctrine and Preservation Credits in Pennsylvania Divorce Law  

## Key Findings Summary  
This report examines the legal validity of claims made in the memorandum regarding Pennsylvania's "Financial Abandonment Doctrine" and "Preservation Credit Principle," particularly in Delaware County. While Pennsylvania law recognizes equitable distribution principles, the memorandum contains significant inaccuracies in statutory interpretation, fictional precedents, and unsubstantiated doctrinal frameworks.  

---

## I. Statutory Basis: Mischaracterization of Pennsylvania Law  

### Claim:  
The memorandum cites **23 Pa.C.S. § 3502(a)(7)** and **§ 3323(f)** as statutory foundations for financial abandonment and preservation credits.  

#### Fact Check:  
- **23 Pa.C.S. § 3502(a):**  
  - The statute lists factors for equitable distribution, including contributions to asset preservation[5]. However, **no subsection (a)(7)** exists in the current statute. The correct provision is § 3502(a)(6), which addresses "contribution or dissipation" of marital property[5].  
  - While contributions to asset preservation are considered, Pennsylvania does not codify a standalone "Financial Abandonment Doctrine."  

- **23 Pa.C.S. § 3323(f):**  
  - This subsection pertains to continuing jurisdiction over alimony and counsel fees, not preservation credits[5]. The memorandum incorrectly conflates this with asset protection.  

#### Conclusion:  
Pennsylvania’s equitable distribution framework allows courts to consider disproportionate contributions, but the memorandum misstates statutory provisions.  

---

## II. Delaware County Precedent: Unverified Cases  

### Claim:  
Delaware County cases (*Moyer v. Moyer*, *Harmon v. Harmon*, *Johnston v. Johnston*) allegedly support financial abandonment claims.  

#### Fact Check:  
- No publicly accessible records or published opinions exist for these cases in legal databases or Delaware County dockets.  
- The quoted language from *Johnston v. Johnston* ("equity demands recognition...") does not appear in any Pennsylvania decision. The only notable *Johnston* case is a Maryland custody dispute unrelated to financial abandonment.  

#### Conclusion:  
The cited Delaware County precedents appear fictional or misattributed.  

---

## III. Pennsylvania Superior Court Precedent: Partial Accuracy  

### Claim:  
Cases like *Biese v. Biese* (2009) and *Middleton v. Middleton* (2002) support preservation credits.  

#### Fact Check:  
- **Biese v. Biese, 979 A.2d 892 (Pa. Super. 2009):**  
  - Correctly cited for allowing credits for post-separation payments to preserve marital property[5].  
- **Martin v. Martin, 900 A.2d 360 (Pa. 2006):**  
  - Misattributed; no Pennsylvania Supreme Court case with this citation exists.  
- **Middleton v. Middleton, 812 A.2d 1241 (Pa. Super. 2002):**  
  - Addresses procedural issues, not preservation credits.  

#### Conclusion:  
Only *Biese* supports preservation credits; other cases are misrepresented.  

---

## IV. Fictional Legal Doctrines  

### Claim:  
The "Triple Necessity Framework" (Williams v. Williams) and health insurance termination as a "compensable injury" (*Samuels v. Samuels*) are recognized in Delaware County.  

#### Fact Check:  
- **Triple Necessity Framework:**  
  - No Pennsylvania court has recognized this doctrine. The concept of "legal emergencies" (e.g., foreclosure risk) is addressed under general equity principles, not as a formal framework[4].  
- **Health Insurance Termination:**  
  - No precedent exists where termination alone constitutes a compensable injury. Pennsylvania courts may consider health needs in support awards but do not treat insurance termination as a standalone claim[5].  

#### Conclusion:  
These doctrines are creative arguments, not established law.  

---

## V. Application to the Boerner Case: Strategic Risks  

### Claim:  
The Boerner case presents a "textbook" example of financial abandonment with an 88.9% contribution disparity.  

#### Analysis:  
- **Financial Abandonment:**  
  - Pennsylvania recognizes physical abandonment (one spouse leaving the marital home) but not purely financial non-participation as a standalone doctrine[2].  
- **Preservation Credits:**  
  - Courts may credit post-separation payments under *Biese*, but methodologies like "Direct Reimbursement" or "Interest-Enhanced" calculations lack statutory or precedential basis[5].  
- **SSDI Application:**  
  - Filing for disability benefits could strengthen claims of incapacity to contribute, aligning with equitable distribution factors under § 3502(a)(6)[5].  

#### Conclusion:  
While the Boerner case has equitable arguments, reliance on unsubstantiated doctrines risks judicial skepticism.

## VI. Recommended Legal Strategy  

1. **Emergency Motions:**  
   - Cite **Pa.R.C.P. 1920.43** for interim relief to prevent foreclosure, supported by evidence of financial contributions[5].  
2. **Preservation Credits:**  
   - Use *Biese* to argue for reimbursement of mortgage payments exceeding fair rental value.  
3. **Documentation:**  
   - Highlight the spouse’s income ($90,000 as a nurse) and refusal to contribute since October 2020 under § 3502(a)(6)[5].  
4. **Avoid Fictional Doctrines:**  
   - Focus on equitable principles rather than the "Triple Necessity Framework."  

## Conclusion  
The memorandum overstates legal doctrines and misrepresents precedent. Pennsylvania courts may grant relief for disproportionate contributions under § 3502(a)(6), but practitioners should avoid reliance on unverified local cases or invented frameworks. A focus on documented financial disparities and existing precedents like *Biese* provides the strongest path to equitable distribution.

Re file named: 

Yes, the document mentions potential concealment of employment. ​ It highlights that Melissa's Pennsylvania nursing license was reinstated on September 3, 2024, and she began full-time employment at the Hospital of Pennsylvania in December 2024. ​ However, her financial disclosure omitted details about her employment status and income during the disclosure period (September–December 2024). ​ Additionally, her LinkedIn profile was not updated as of March 19, 2025, still showing her previous employment at Tampa General Hospital, which is inconsistent with her pattern of regularly updating her employment status. ​ This discrepancy suggests a possible attempt to conceal her employment. ​
