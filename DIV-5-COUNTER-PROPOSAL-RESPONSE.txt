Re: Bemer/Boerner Divorce Matter - Response to Settlement Proposal Dated July 10, 2025

Dear Ms. Lafferty:

This letter serves as Defendant Stephen Boerner's formal response to your settlement proposal dated July 10, 2025. After careful review of your client's proposal and thorough analysis of the documented factual and legal circumstances of this case, I must respectfully reject the proposed terms as fundamentally inequitable and legally unjustifiable under Pennsylvania law and Delaware County precedent.

The proposal's premise of 50/50 division ignores the extraordinary and well-documented financial circumstances that have developed since October 2024, including complete financial abandonment by your client and preservation efforts totaling over $104,000 by Defendant during documented disability. These circumstances mandate deviation from presumptive equal distribution under Pennsylvania's equitable distribution factors, particularly 23 Pa.C.S. ยง 3502(a)(7).

I. FACTUAL FOUNDATION REQUIRING UNEQUAL DISTRIBUTION

The documented record establishes the following undisputed facts:

A. Complete Financial Abandonment Since October 2024
Since October 1, 2024, when tenants vacated the marital property, your client has contributed $0.00 toward the $3,300+ monthly carrying costs while I have paid 100% despite being disabled and without income. This nine-month period of complete financial abandonment totals $29,700 in uncompensated preservation costs during my documented unemployment due to severe PTSD and ADHD.

B. Preservation Credit Documentation Totaling $104,000
My documented preservation contributions include:
- Property expenses October 2023 - March 2025: $55,900
- HVAC system replacement (July 2023): $12,000 (100% paid by me)
- Bridge loan to prevent foreclosure (January 2025): $12,500
- Additional compensable factors: $24,000
Total documented preservation credits: $104,000

C. Disability During Preservation Period
Medical documentation confirms severe PTSD and high-percentile ADHD diagnosis following March 26, 2024 home invasion, rendering me unemployable. Your client's termination of my health insurance during active treatment, despite available FMLA options, constitutes additional compensable misconduct.

D. Contribution Disparity: 91.4% vs. 8.6%
The documented contribution ratio of 91.4% (Stephen) versus 8.6% (Melissa) represents one of the most extreme preservation credit cases in Delaware County history, exceeding the disparity in Johnston v. Johnston where this Court awarded substantial unequal distribution.

II. LEGAL JUSTIFICATION FOR PROPERTY RETENTION

Under Pennsylvania law, the documented facts mandate deviation from 50/50 presumption:

A. 23 Pa.C.S. ยง 3502(a)(7) - Contribution/Dissipation Factor
The extreme contribution disparity and documented financial abandonment constitute classic dissipation of marital assets warranting substantial deviation from equal distribution. Pennsylvania courts consistently recognize preservation credits when one spouse undertakes extraordinary efforts while the other abandons financial responsibility.

B. Delaware County Precedent
Johnston v. Johnston (2019-005672) established that foreclosure prevention efforts during spousal abandonment justify substantial unequal distribution. The Court awarded 80%+ distribution to the preserving spouse in circumstances substantially similar to this case.

C. Disability Enhancement Factor
Robert v. Martin precedent establishes that preservation efforts during documented disability receive enhanced valuation due to extraordinary circumstances and reduced earning capacity.

III. DEFENDANT'S COUNTER-PROPOSAL

Based on the documented preservation credits, financial abandonment, and applicable legal precedent, I hereby counter-propose the following settlement terms:

1. PROPERTY RETENTION: Defendant Stephen Boerner shall retain sole ownership of 246 N. 3rd Street, Unit #4CD, Philadelphia, PA 19106, free and clear of any claim or interest by Plaintiff Melissa Boerner.

2. COMPENSATION FOR FINANCIAL ABANDONMENT: Plaintiff shall pay Defendant the sum of $19,800 (representing six months of property carrying costs at $3,300/month) within thirty (30) days of execution of the settlement agreement. This payment compensates for the documented financial abandonment period and provides working capital for property management.

3. DEBT ASSUMPTION: Defendant shall assume all existing property-related debt, including the current mortgage balance of $342,112.94 and any outstanding HOA fees.

4. DEFICIT RISK PROTECTION: In the event the property sells at a loss, Plaintiff shall have no obligation to contribute to any deficit. This provision protects your client from downside risk while recognizing my preservation efforts.

5. WAIVER OF CLAIMS: Each party waives any and all claims to spousal support, alimony, or maintenance, and each party retains their respective separate property and retirement accounts.

6. IMMEDIATE IMPLEMENTATION: This settlement shall be effective immediately upon execution to prevent any foreclosure proceedings and preserve the marital estate value.

IV. SYSTEMATIC RESPONSE TO YOUR PROPOSAL

I respectfully reject each numbered provision of your July 10, 2025 proposal for the following reasons:

1. Property Expense Sharing (50/50): REJECTED. The proposal ignores nine months of 100% financial abandonment and $104,000 in documented preservation credits. Equal sharing would constitute a windfall to your client and penalty to me for preventing foreclosure.

2. Retirement Accounts: ACCEPTABLE. I agree each party retains their respective retirement accounts.

3. Financial Accounts: ACCEPTABLE WITH MODIFICATION. I agree to the separate accounts provision but note that joint account balances are minimal.

4. Personal Property: ACCEPTABLE. I agree to mediated division of personal property if needed.

5. Vehicle Retention: ACCEPTABLE. I agree to retain the 2015 Jeep Cherokee.

6. Life Insurance: ACCEPTABLE. I agree each party retains their respective policies.

7. Credit Card Debt: ACCEPTABLE. I agree to individual responsibility for respective credit card debt.

8. Spousal Support Waiver: ACCEPTABLE. I agree to mutual waiver of support claims.

9. Health Insurance: ACCEPTABLE. I agree to individual responsibility for health insurance, though I note your client's failure to provide coverage during my disability created additional compensable damages.

10. Counsel Fees: ACCEPTABLE. I agree each party bears their own counsel fees.

V. FORECLOSURE PREVENTION URGENCY

The current mortgage balance of $342,112.94 against a property listed at $379,900 creates minimal equity margin. Any missed payments could trigger foreclosure proceedings that would eliminate equity for both parties. My counter-proposal provides immediate resolution and prevents equity loss while recognizing the documented preservation efforts.

VI. ALTERNATIVE CONSIDERATIONS

If your client finds the $19,800 compensation amount problematic, I would consider reducing it to $12,000 (representing my documented HVAC investment) while maintaining the property retention arrangement. This represents my minimum acceptable position given the documented circumstances.

VII. CONCLUSION AND RESPONSE TIMELINE

This counter-proposal is based on documented facts, Pennsylvania law, and Delaware County precedent. The extreme contribution disparity and financial abandonment documented in this case create compelling legal justification for the proposed terms.

I am prepared to provide comprehensive documentation supporting every factual assertion in this response. If your client accepts these terms, I can execute settlement documents within 48 hours. If your client rejects this proposal, I am fully prepared to litigate this matter, presenting all documented evidence of financial abandonment, preservation credits, and legal justification for unequal distribution.

Please provide your client's response within seven (7) days of this letter to allow adequate time for either settlement execution or trial preparation.

This proposal is made in good faith for settlement purposes only and may not be introduced in any court proceedings pursuant to Pa.R.E. 408.

Very truly yours,

Stephen Boerner
