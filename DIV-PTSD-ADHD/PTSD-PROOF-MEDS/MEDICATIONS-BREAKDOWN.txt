which cagtegory should i force Olmesartan-Amlodipine-HCTZ into

Olmesartan-Amlodipine-HCTZ is an antihypertensive medication used to manage high blood pressure. Since it does not fit neatly into any of the psychiatric medication categories provided in the screenshot, you might consider the following options:

1. **Sedatives/Sleep Aides**: If there is no category for antihypertensive medications, and you need to place it somewhere, this could be a forced fit since it is also involved in managing symptoms that could be related to stress or anxiety, albeit indirectly.

2. **Other**: If there is an "Other" option in any category or if you can add items under a miscellaneous section, that would be the most appropriate place.

Given the constraints and the context provided in the screenshot, placing it under "Other" (if available) or "Sedatives/Sleep Aides" as a last resort might be the best approach. However, keep in mind this is a forced fit and not an accurate representation of its use.
