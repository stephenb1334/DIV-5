# Strategic Implementation Guide for PTSD Documentation in Multiple Legal Proceedings

## Executive Summary

This guide provides strategic recommendations for maximizing the effectiveness of Stephen Boerner's notarized medical records request across his Delaware County divorce proceedings, Florida landlord-tenant litigation, and SSDI application. The coordinated evidence approach ensures consistent documentation while leveraging jurisdiction-specific advantages.

## Legal Authentication and Cross-Jurisdictional Requirements

### Federal Rules of Evidence Compliance

Under FRE 803(6), medical records qualify for the business records hearsay exception when properly authenticated[27][28]. The notarized Florida request satisfies authentication requirements through:

**Custodian of Records Certification**: Mark Sig's professional credentials establish him as qualified custodian
**Regular Business Activity**: Therapy notes created during routine clinical practice
**Contemporaneous Documentation**: Records made at or near the time of events described
**Foundation Testimony**: Mark's availability for expert testimony provides live witness authentication

### Pennsylvania Admissibility Standards

Pennsylvania Rule of Evidence 901 requires authentication sufficient to support a finding that evidence is what it claims to be[30]. The notarized request meets these standards by:

- **Witness with Personal Knowledge**: Mark Sig's direct clinical observations
- **Professional Documentation**: Licensed therapist's clinical records
- **Stipulation Alternative**: Parties can agree to authenticity to streamline proceedings
- **Chain of Custody**: Documented therapeutic relationship from pre-trauma through present
