**Mark:** Hey, it more? Steven, can you hear me? Look at that hair.

**Steven:** I know, right? Nice. You're channeling my prior self. It's my... I call it my hurricane hair.

**Mark:** Nice. How is... I haven't... Yeah, I haven't had a haircut since pre-hurricane. And I don't want to use your therapy tank for all this, but I once went like 11 years without a haircut. Like, it was down my, literally down to my butt. Like, I could tuck my hair into my pants. Of course, I was in my 20s and 30s. So now I'm just trying to see if I can still do it. I don't know.

**Steven:** Nice. Looks great.

**Mark:** Yeah, we'll give it. I'm going to give it, like a year or two, and, you know, my wife likes it, so... It's in that weird, awkward stage right now. You look great. Your hair is all nice and quainted and this looking all nice, although I see a little gray. I don't think I saw that before.

**Steven:** Well, no, life will do it. No, I gave myself a haircut. I was in the town in Maryland that I stay at. My parents have a place for my hideout. I just... There's no barber. It's like a one blinking light town. And so I cut it not too long ago myself.

**Mark:** Watch it. You know, not bad. I got a little bit of feedback on your end. Let's to see here. You know? Yeah. Do you have an iPhone?

**Steven:** I do. The feedback's not too bad. It's really not. If it's okay on your end, then it's fine.

**Mark:** Yeah. Yeah, yeah. We'll we'll let it rip. If it whatever, you know, if it gets to a point, we can always FaceTime so long as you're comfortable with that.

**Steven:** Yeah, no, it's pretty good. Google. It's cut out pretty good. So, but yeah, so I have, yeah, I kind of gave you the overview of, you know, what was happening. I think everything's just settled. I find myself being on edge or edgy around people or scared, like very easily, like extremely. If you come up behind me, I have to tell people, like, you know... It's not like I turn around and I'm like, you know, karate hands ready to go or anything, but it's hard for people to remember that, and I feel like it's difficult to relate to what happened. So I think it's also hard to talk about what happened if you're a parent or something, right? And so I find that being the break in specifically, being something that was in the back burner of stuff that I was dealing with, and while everything else is settled and found its course, that hasn't. You know, so I...

**Mark:** Well, it really sounds like textbook post traumatic stress disorder. I mean, textbook. Like, you're operating from the criteria this, Steve, and I'm not, I'm not like, it's not that I'm relishing it, but I say this from a strength based perspective where this is a good thing. Now you can identify it, now you can see it. Especially one of those real key factors, they call it that heightened startle response. That is a tremendously large red flag of PTSD, a heightened startle response, whereas something that I don't want to use this phrase, but like, under normal circumstances, a person wouldn't, you know, like, freak out, but because of what you experienced, a tremendous violation of your safety, and at the time, Melissa's as well, right? You know, it's, I'll absolutely validate it. I really will. The good news is you can work through that. There's things that, although it doesn't always translate via telehealth, you know, like different trauma techniques and things to alleviate the distress, you know?

**Steven:** Yeah, I think it's... I think just, there's the trauma, like, I guess I'm redefining what trauma is because I imagined it as an acute event, which part of mine was, if everything else was peachy, that would be the one acute event. But then there was the, I would say, you know, the opposite of acute, but it was the sustained trauma of, you know, action and reaction. Like the break-in was an action reaction, but it was Melissa was a big part of it because I lived on edge because of her frustration with me. And anything that I did, you know, was would magnify the problem and then I would just work all day, get out of the house, and I would try so hard and give all of myself into something that I couldn't pull back and I couldn't get answers on my why I couldn't pull it back. And then she would be mad at me and I wouldn't know why and she wouldn't tell me. And, you know, she would freak out and, you know, but then she'd pull me back in. And that was something that she did a lot of, is like, pull me back in and I have text messages that are like, I'm hesitant to meet you at the pier because it's all of a sudden you're very friendly and I just don't understand it. And when I get there, it's going to blow up and I... it's just like she pull me in, you know, crack me down, and then I'd fall back. Then I pull in a little bit more and I in a crumble. And so I became this, you know, and this was all after the break, the break in was March 26, 2024.

**Mark:** Wow.

**Steven:** Yeah. I have, you know, I look at all of our text messages, the pictures we took together, you know, the intimacy that we had, all those things where, you know, I always said February was the best of 24, the best month of our relationship, you know, January, December. And we had difficult times, but we also were getting really close through that, you know? And so when the break in happened, we had everything changed after that. You know, and so a lot of my frustration is because I'm in this you know, landlord tenant thing still with this landlord from down your way. And you know, his arrogance around the fact that he didn't have to do anything, wasn't obligated to do anything, but he promised... you know, he did things like promise me, you know, not saying the word promise, but, you know, hey, I acknowledge that those wooden gates are falling apart. Let's get you some metal ones. Would you feel better then, yes, and then I'd go tell Melissa. And it would create this atmosphere of, I'm taking his name Luther. I'm taking Luther's word to Melissa. Melissa, and then she's calling me a man I'm not a man of my word because those things aren't done. And I am...

**Mark:** Oh, wow.

**Steven:** And then so I'd go back to Luther and I would say, oh, yeah, also, like there's motion lights that are not working, then there's like, what else was there? Oh, we don't have, there's no, everyone else has security cameras. We don't, you know, and he was lead me on to think things were getting done, and then I'd finally hear back after not acknowledging and he would say, like, you can install those cameras, but just no drilling. And then that would be it. He wouldn't, you know, it was. And so I find myself extremely angry at him for that.

**Mark:** Sure.

**Steven:** Because, you know, when I look back at all the messages I went going through divorce and then going through this landlord tenant dispute, I've relived all these text messages and everything over and over again, and I could just I could just very clearly see. And now I'm not looking for a place to put the anger and take it out on somebody for the sake of that. I'm trying to find answers in resolving myself first and deciding if I want to pursue anything with him. And I'm still undecided, but I've gotten a bit obsessed as well with this case of what I have against him, because as I've taken my anger and relived all these things and then had to go back and for the divorce pull up the lease and go through all this stuff, I started to see these irregularities in the lease. And I started to... You know, I'm a really good sleuth. And so I start to look into this. Like, why did he put the address in Gulfport as the landlord address five times? You know, where's... And then he changed after one month's, you, move in cost, he he said, oh, he wrote us a package. He said, here's eight pre-addressed envelopes, pre-stamped, send your rent checks to a Marlu Enterprises in North Carolina. And so we just in good faith started sending our rent checks to this company in North Carolina. And then I start looking, I don't know the law. And so I now have like a lawyer's level of knowledge around landlord tenant law, but that you can't, let's just say you can't do that. And the company, yeah... you know, the company is also not approved to do business in Florida. And then I just recently uncovered the fact that it's not actually a business. It's a shell name that he filed in North Carolina, and it's all it's all tax fraud. And he's actually a part of quite a big web of individuals who coordinate and buy and sell real estate to each other and they're all in on it. And so I'm living this crime. It's actually entertaining for me and more healthy and more healthy... That's just perspective. You know, I waited until April 15th before I was going to do something. I still haven't, because April 15th, I knew he'd file his taxes and not report on the income. And I wrote him $36,000 to his company in North Carolina. And so I can take this to court and, you know, he also, you know, a breach of habitability. You can't say, you know, there's a security issues, there's no locks, there's no, this or that. And he didn't do anything. We had a clogged sink. He didn't he responded. Like, this guy is is awful, is a terrible landlord. So you know, he kept my whole security deposit and $4,200 of my personal belongings. and then blocked me from getting it.

**Mark:** Yeah, and then blocked me from getting it.

**Steven:** I was there out front. And so him and the realtor were, you, working it together and both the realtor was just like, Luther told me to stop cease communication. And so these two men who were, you know, my, you, I communicated with them throughout the lease, all friendly, you know, I let the landlord know, I said, hey, I got PTSD from that event you know about it. I moved out two days late because of a storm on Labor Day. My movers bailed. Melissa wasn't there to help me. I stayed I stayed two days after the lease. And so he, you know, disclosed that, and there's lots of laws around their responsibilities. And so, you know, I've got a really big case if I want to go after Compass Realty, the Realtor, and this, uh, guy who's from Florida, who's a lawyer. He's also a lawyer, and he's also sits on committees for like, you know, lawyers and ethics and all this stuff. So, uh...

**Mark:** Oh, how ironic.

**Steven:** Yeah, for the Supreme Court of Missouri, too. It's like, um, you know, so when you look at punitive damages as like a multiplier of damages. It's like if you egregious and premeditated, it's really hard to prove, but like, you know, I don't need a lawyer to tell me that this case has all the multipliers in it. You know, at least the lease is, you, null and void, in in my opinion. I just went back, basically, all the money that I paid his defunct company or his nonexistent company. But I also wanted to ring the Justice bell, and this guy's treats tenants like this all over the place. He walked all over him.

**Mark:** I was going to say. Yeah, he's it to you he's...

**Steven:** Oh, and he's so full of shit. Yeah, and he's just an awful person, and he knows, you know, all day he's sitting there listening to how lawyers are breaking the law. It's like he watches so much of this same show. He knows how to do it, all this. He's genius. I go into all his deeds, all his records. I mean, I've gotten everything. How he bought that house was, you know, and I have all this information and it's a powerful position to be in, and I'm deciding what I want to do to it. I'm going to take him to the bar associations that he's in, I'm going to IRS, like everything. It'll bring down his house. But I also, you know, I can't do it unless there's a financial end to that, because it's I have hundreds of hours into this, I'm not even kidding you. I'm actually... You know, on the one of the reasons I am, and one of the reasons I've been able to find all these things is I've been building a product that's for technology to help people represent themselves pro se in these types of builders.

**Mark:** Yeah, so that's the reason why I've been spending so much time.

**Steven:** And I'm also the opportunity behind the crisis. And with Melissa, I fired my attorney, so I'm a pro se attorney on record for myself in that as of last week.

**Mark:** Wow. Yeah. I saw that in your email. I read your email, but then I forced myself... What was... Trying not to have preconceived notions, I want to be tainted, I I wanted to get your perspective and get your perceptions. What is the present status of your marriage? Like, is your marriage been dissolved? I mean, what's going on?

**Steven:** It's so funny to hear that question. I used to hear you ask that question, and it was, you know, I had a response of, good and bad. Right.

**Mark:** Yeah, no, it's...

**Steven:** It's, how many months are we in now? It's taken forever. Our property that we own together in Philly hasn't sold yet, which has just absolutely destroyed me financially, because I've been paying you, $3,500 bucks a month, and she has, you know, decided not to pay. And so I've decided that I'm going to stop paying, because I'm so financially stressed and have such a you know, I paid for six months while it was vacant, and she just told me to fuck off. And now I'm getting blamed for reducing the price, you know, and you know, I'm getting it's not making a whole lot of sense, but you know, the house is bringing the condo's bringing me under. I'm going to let it, it's going into its second month as of like today of nonpayment. I'll let it go to foreclosure unless it sells. And then we get a little pop. But I'm getting blamed for it all. But also the only way that I I have a chance of fighting back in this divorce is because I got diagnosed with a PTSD and she abandoned, you know, she got a job and then she left without telling me. I found out I didn't have insurance anymore. you know, and so she, it was, you know, it's medical abandonment and financial abandonment. And then she went and got a job in December and she should have told me because I'm eligible to be on her benefits, but I'm paying for the Maryland exchanges right now. And, you know, so I really feel like I'm blamed and I blame myself, but I don't know why, because I've never learned from her why. But then I step back and I realize how twisted my mind has gotten to even think that when I think of her abandonment of all these things. So, you know, it's not going well, but it doesn't weigh on me. I've accepted that it could foreclose. I'm essentially washed myself out financially. You know, the only way I don't give her two years of alimony is if I file for Social Security disability. My lawyer, that was their lawyer's was the main thing was, you should file, you really need to file because I haven't worked. I've lost consulting gigs that haven't paid because I'm mentally struggling.

**Mark:** Sure.

**Steven:** I've lost three clients since that break in, and I haven't made a dime. You know, I work every day, I'm I'm progressing things. It takes me forever to do something.

**Mark:** Right.

**Steven:** And I'm starting to come around to, am I filing to file and using that card to fight or is it, am I actually suffering from all the trauma that was acute and nonacute? And how much is it my fault most Melissa's fault or the landlord, you know? And so I find myself developing grief, self blame, and then attributing it a lot of it to the, you know, the Lord... Lord have really affected their relationship with the stuff the landlord didn't do. That's one of the biggest issues, where I start to put my anger in this. And I just I want to get past it, you know, if I go down that route with the landlord, that could be two years of reliving it. You know?

**Mark:** All right. So I'm in this, what's the the cost? You know, but it also could be closure, and it could be, you, as my dad puts it, like, you know, a punching bag to where I'm in control, I's a sweetheart, I'm excited when I talk about it. I'm developing a product out of this in legal tech and applying AI, and it's fascinating, what I've been able to build and learn. You know, so it's like, to see it all the way through would give me such a bird's eye view of like the person I'm building this for. So maybe I pursue it in that spirit, but I'm not gold digging. His liability is so high with this that it's tempting to look at it like that, but I don't expect to get a dime from it. You know, it's one of those things, but it could be a historic case in Florida, and I kid you not. People think I'm crazy when I say that. There's no...

**Steven:** It sounds ridiculous.

**Mark:** I don't think you're crazy. I don't think you're crazy at all. There's no case. I was just going to say, Florida's never seen a case like this. never had a break in, never had, you know, all these things that are wild took place. There's cases around the state that have been bits and pieces of it, strong bits and pieces. But I've got them all. I've got them all. And then that's uncovering this, you know, multi-state scheme he's a part of is just wild. And so without all the deeds details, I sit down to work and I spin and I have a block in my head that doesn't allow me to do what I need to do, and I get lost in doing the things that I shouldn't do. When I watch myself do it. I watch myself do it. I'm extremely unproductive.

**Mark:** Yeah. Well, what? Let me ask you this. You say you're unproductive, but yet, it's not like you're laying in bed all day long, right? Like you're getting up, you're suiting up, you're showing up. What is the... If you say you're not being productive, well, then what does being productive mean or look like?

**Steven:** It's around for me, it's like task management, project management. It's like being organized to see the path, the roadmap ahead of what I need to do and when. And when I go in, I go to this really nice hotel around the corner, this town I'm in, where I grew up, just got like the nicest main street in the U.S. or something. But I walked on this main street and they got this hotel lobby I go to. It's beautiful. And I sat there for 10 hours yesterday, and I knew...

**Mark:** What? Yeah. I mean, in and out, you know, I walk in and out, but it was a 10 hour block.

**Steven:** Sure. You know, and I have like, two things that I really need to do and and you know, the good advice my mom will give or someone is like, oh, yeah, like, give yourself a word afterwards and go do those things. But for whatever reason, my mind stops me from doing it. You know, I get lost in finding it in the App Store, you know, in a new app or going into the settings of a new new tools and I know what I'm doing it and I let myself do it. And it's almost like doing something to forward myself and, you know, what would it look like? It would be like a very good detailed plan of all the projects and the task within and all the things I need to do and, you know, pull my mom and she's offered to help and just say, hey, like, we have to tackle these things. But in tackling those things, it's looking at a lot of things in, you know, the eyes. And I think that's where I struggle is I'm so tired of it all. It's been a nonstop battle since Florida started, and I lost I got fired and I lost my brother-in-law and sister because I worked for the company down there. And that was in December of 23 is when that all happened. And it was a battle leading up to it and I got there in like August of 23. And so it just, it's finally settled from a day to day, but the remnants are still there. And I have to face it.

**Mark:** So there was, you were starting to enter into litigation against your was it your sister and your brother in law? Right? I mean...

**Steven:** My sister was married, and brother in law was a partner and I was a partner and, you know, she was just in the outskirts, but they lied to us, you know, pulled the rug out in terms of insurance when we got down there, lowered my, I cut my salary down tremendously. Didn't have the money they told me.

**Mark:** Yeah. I stopped. I pulled that back. I'm not pursuing that legally.

**Steven:** Okay, so that is... Done. That is... That case is closed, so to speak. Are you at a level of acceptance as it pertains to that?

**Mark:** Yeah, I'm okay with that. doesn't. Yeah, that one was really a sad one because I don't see my niece and nephew anymore. And, you know, it's really, when I think about that, it's really sad. It's it's, you know, she calls my dad on his birthday and there's this awkwardness. You know, it's not like we all used to get on Facebook and everything anymore. It's it's... Since that moment, but my parents are aligned with me. They just keep it to ourselves. And my sister made some poor decisions, so did he. So it's nice to have their support in what happened.

**Steven:** Okay. Okay, that was my question, like, what's the familial aftermath as a result of this? Like, the relationship between you and your sister, is it just nonexistent at this point?

**Mark:** Yeah, nonexistent. I don't know. Yeah. And they're kids too. So it's...

**Steven:** That's a bummer.

**Mark:** Yeah. That is a bummer. Yeah, so that, I feel sad about the outcome. I don't reminisce about a whole lot about what happened. I mean, I do, but, you know, I've got the other stuff wins. I don't, you know, it's the break and it's the divorce. I mean, those are, it's the landlord. You know, those are you know, the thing is on edge. I feel calm today, I think, because I was coming into this session.

**Steven:** Good. But I'm glad you reached out. That's brave. Yeah. You know I'm not implying that you dodged a bullet by no means, but, like, and I don't say this to be coy. Like, like the hurricanes would have been the absolute knockout punch for your trauma had you stayed down here. It was horrifying.

**Mark:** Ugh, I can't imagine. I wish I was there, honestly, after all happened. I knew what you mean, though.

**Steven:** Yeah. Like, just out of moral sense.

**Mark:** Yeah, I mean... Have you been back? When was the last time time you were in the city of Gulfport?

**Steven:** I left in September of 24. Right before the hurricanes.

**Mark:** Oh, right before. Right before. Yeah, I were they were. I got a text message on my drive or something like, you know, coming back, and then I followed it. So I was getting back, I drove all the way up. ran into a car and all that stuff. Yeah. So I had, I just felt for you guys so much. But yeah, you know what? I, um, that could have, it could have been, you know, especially about a home or, you know, stuff like that, I would have, um, it must have been just so tough for everybody down there.

**Steven:** Yeah. Well, it's... a lot losing you. I think it all like living out of a garbage bag, you know, just Airbnb. So in that respect, from a strength based perspective, you dodge that bullet, you, which given the series of hits that you were enduring with the trauma, the breaking and entering, and then you and Melissa, and the micro trauma after micro trauma after micro trauma, I can only imagine the psychological state that you would have been in post hurricane had you been down here. You know what I mean?

**Mark:** Yeah, it was, I mean. I was in a spiral. On my drive back, I was in a spiral. I mean, it took me almost 10 days to get back. I was late with my car. It was late. I had to rent a big car, you because Melissa took my car. And you know, and I just I just remember being like three days late on that and just like the bill was like a thousand bucks extra. And because I just, I was like spinning, I was just trying to like slide into home and then deal with the aftermath, but I couldn't get through the day of driving some days. I was just, so tired. One day, you know, one day I just pulled into a parking lot at a gas station in the middle of nowhere and just literally slept for two and a half days, and Lucy was with me. I get her out and stuff, but it was like, you know, I had an excursion, so, you know, I end up ditching a lot of my stuff, and I just slept in the back of this thing.

**Steven:** Wow!

**Mark:** Oh, yeah, I got... Yeah, I just I stay in a dirty hotel just just to sleep you know. But I was also just spinning the whole time. I didn't really stop spinning until you know, maybe a few months ago, even when I was calm through the winter, I was in the middle of nowhere by myself a lot, which was great. But with no structure or direction either. I would just work on what I'm working on and push off the important stuff and just try to hide. It was literally hiding, literally hiding.

**Steven:** Right. And I still feel like I'm doing that.

**Mark:** Okay. Yeah. Yeah, so, you know, and if I haven't brought this up in the previous session, then I'm bringing it up right now, you know, the evidence based three prong approach to sustained change, right? I'm trying to facilitate some kind of change. Let's say I'm an alcoholic, I'm active in my addiction, and I want to embrace recovery, right? I want to live a life of abstinence, and I want to recover. The three prong approach, or I have either a chronic trauma that I've been dealing with, or an acute trauma, or dare I say, a complex trauma, which is to say that it doesn't go away, and it affects all senses. The three pronged approach, Steve, is one something therapeutic. Whatever that is, you got to do something therapeutic. In a perfect world, you see a therapist. That's what you're doing right now. So you can check that off the list. The second prong of that, and these are big, big, broad imperatives. The second prong is fellowship, you know, something. And I wonder, do you have fellowship? Do you have a tribe? Do you have a posse? Whatever that is, for some, again, using the analogy of the alcoholic, well, if they go to AA, you know, like that's what they do. They go to AA, and that's their fellowship. For some people, it's their neighborhood. For some people, it's the church. For some people, it's, I don't know, some organization, some fraternal organization, the moose Lodge. I don't know. The corner pub. You know...

**Steven:** I have little pockets of that when I go to Philly, Sometimes I stay at my condo, and, you know, the bartenders here, there, and things like that, I still feel that as I do my rounds, 'cause everybody remembers me and I get to see them, and I click into that, but it's not a, I wouldn't call a tribe. You know, in each town, I kind of have little pockets, but it's scattered and I leave, and then I go, I'm rotating like three places right now, mine and then my parents have a real small place near the water in the Chesapeake Bay, and then here in Bethlehem, where we grew up. you know, so I just kind of bounce around. And so anything that's a tribe, nobody misses me when I'm gone or notices. It's not like that. I feel like I'm more... I'm sorry when I go out, I talk to people, I mean, I, you know, make conversation with everyone. On the face of it, it feels like a relief for me to do that, to ham it up with, you know, make some jokes and stuff like that. And then when I sit down, but when I sit down, I'm depressed. you know, and I think about who I was at that register and you know, almost how fake it was, but also like it was like a relief just because they don't know me, I don't know them. And or if we do know each other, it's just through that register experience. And it's a nice relief from myself, frankly. So I don't feel like it's like fraudulent, but no, I don't have a, I've had that tight group. I've been all teams and I've been on and all that stuff, right? I feel way more of a loner. I'm unresponsive to friends a lot as well.

**Mark:** Really? You still got your buddy in Austin?

**Steven:** I talked to him all the time, yeah, yeah. And a friend from Gulfport, who was a true friend, who really came to visit me in Philly. He stayed at the condo and completely empty condo couch and a bed, but we had a blast. One of my best friends. and I even find myself sometimes just taking a break from him because he's very wants to help a lot. Sometimes I don't want help or I don't want to talk about it. you know?

**Mark:** Right.

**Steven:** And he's such a good helper. That's what he does. He's a shepherd for people, and I'm blessed to have him as a friend, but, you know, I find myself introverted far more than I used to be, but I also love being by myself. I find good company in myself.

**Mark:** Yeah. Okay. That's the next, you know, part of my session prep is. And around you alone and being lonely. Do you find your stuff? Like, how would you describe that? Are you lonely? Like, do you yearn? No. For a human contact? Or are you, like, yearning for intimacy? And I'm not just talking about like having sex or anything like that. I mean, like, the warm body, you know, the human contact, the actual intimacy.

**Steven:** You know, my mom and dad are huggers, hug my mom when I see her in the morning. Sometimes I'm with my dad for a week or so, and something my mom, they's together, but there's go back and they go in different directions.

**Mark:** Sure.

**Steven:** The tennis stuff. So I'll stay sometime with my dad and then sometimes my mom, sometimes we're all together. And we get along really well. And, you know, you know, so I get my mom is the best hugger in the league, you know, so I get that, you know, we talk about, you know, 20 seconds, you kind of get that dopamine, so we count for fun sometimes. It's like, you know, and then I have their dog and, you know, we lost a dog recently, but, you know, all that kind of, and then Lucy, my dog. So... So, I mean, I hugged my dog like she's...

**Mark:** Where is Lucy?

**Steven:** She's in the other room.

**Mark:** Oh, okay. So you got her there.

**Steven:** Yeah, so, I mean, I, that dog is a, you know, a daughter, but like, I mean, there's... I mean, she's just, has been through me everything I described in the car, I mean, the whole way. And I took her and had to make, you know, a move because Melissa was going to take her, you know, and so she's my dog, you know, it took her. But I have a lot of guilt around that too. And but Lucy's my, you know, saving grace. I mean, that dog has been everything for me. So I hug her like all day. I mean, she's true. And I got her as an awesome service dog, you know, easy, not hard to do a PTSD. It's kind of an easy one of the group to do it. But I also did it so she wouldn't Melissa wouldn't make a case and to take, say I couldn't take care of myself. She was starting to say, I can't take care of myself. I can't take care of a dog.

**Mark:** I mean, that's starting to question your competency, Steve.

**Steven:** Yes, that's what's at her and her lawyers, her lawyers, that's when they're coming at. I get that all the time. I mean, it's...

**Mark:** You are a lot of things, but you're not incompetent.

**Steven:** Yeah, so if I're a lot. Part of being pro se and representing myself is that if I do it very competently, I then hurt my case for the disability that I've endured and my inability to work, because I frankly haven't gone out to get a job because I've been advised if I can sustain myself not to, because if I get a job, the disability's out the window and I'm going to pay two years alimony, and they're gonna wash 2024, and they're gonna look at the years they want, and I do that. So it's like, I can't, but I also can't. Like, I just, I can't. You know? So I'm in this like, um imposter syndrome. It's a quadri. It's such an imposter syndrome. Because people in my corner, we all know that I'm kind of not getting a job. My parents are helping me. My dad's, I have a card for you to give to you today because they encourage this and we're going to pay for it. And so, but it's an awful feeling to accept that help. I've got around on it, but, you know, I have to play the disability card because otherwise the female wins, man. It's just how it goes. And my cards are stacked against me. So I have to file for disability. I probably have to get somebody like yourself. I got diagnosed, but my paperwork, the report says, could be a PTSD acute or it could be something else and it's not clear. And so it's like, as I'm putting all together stuff to file, I'm like, I don't even know if I have enough, but Melissa was in the room and that woman was as convinced as you were that I it was PTSD, and I can tell you that it is.

**Mark:** Well, let's cognitively diffuse it. Why wouldn't it be? It is. I mean, yeah, it's like... that's it. If we look at it, you know, we cognitively diffuse it, like, why wouldn't? Yeah. I mean, it's just that isolated event, a home invasion, man. You know, like, God, I been the from. Like, nothing happened. Like, they're like, oh, that was just old drunk Billy.

**Steven:** Yeah, exactly.

**Mark:** Billy? It's a big deal.

**Steven:** I know, Melissa's family's fairly, you know, I think, connected or kind of, you know, and so it's been suspicion that they were behind her. Melissa knew about it, just because, so I start to go down this path of like paranoia where, you know, I've really thought about this a lot and it's a hard. I won't pull this card ever because to pull it and miss is terrible. But her reaction to that day and that event was so neutral and bizarre that... it just seems so weird. I you know, hashed out all the everything, but I have so much time to think about this, it just seems, you know, I didn't see her going to some street gang and, you know, pulling a guy and, you, paying him on the side, but her family's the kind that called into the state of Florida and got me moved to where I needed to see people under the insurance that we had. It was a year wait for some of the stuff that I did, and I got it quick because of that. you know, I don't know who made those calls, but they have a lot of doctors, a lot of, you know, this or that. So could they have they wanted me to roll over and take all these medicine medications and come back to Pennsylvania? And I I wanted to fight. I wanted to stay.

**Mark:** Sure.

**Steven:** And then it all fell apart. And so that could have happened. So I lived that life of contemplating that. Like, and again, I don't want to go down the supposition rabbit hole, but are you implying that in some way, shape or form, that Melissa's family could have I don't know, had an influence in this guy breaking into the house.

**Mark:** It's possible, you know?

**Steven:** Okay.

**Mark:** I look at a text... Shit, anything's possible. I was just in Mexico at a place called Chichen Itza, the Mayan ruins. There's a theory that aliens abducted to everyone, that they all got aboard, the mothership, and they all disappeared. I can't disprove it. it could it's possible. It could have happened. I don't know. Melissa's parents could have pulled some strings and gotten some drunk yokel local yokel knuckle handed. got a call. Just to terrorize. Just to terrorize you. Somebody held something over them and said, you know, go to this place or something.

**Steven:** Melissa sent me a text message two days, three days before before it happened, and it was a screenshot of a saying that said, you know, 3 a.m. is the hour of like workers and artists or something. And it was 3 a.m., three days later, you know, it just, if I had a place a bet, I would say no, right? So I don't want to get too caught up on that because it's just as so ridiculous.

**Mark:** Right.

**Steven:** But the no one has gotten a stranger response and I there was nothing. No one's ever beaten up the guy who came into his house and in front of his wife and gotten less than I have. Like, there was no. There was no thank you. There was no anything.

**Mark:** Yeah. No. There was nothing. Yeah, and this is an unfair question. I'm just kind of putting it into the cosmos. How come Melissa doesn't have trauma as a result of this? I'm just, you know, I'm... None. It's not fair, but I'm personalizing your situation, where I'm thinking how my wife would react, given her emotional comportment, she'd be in therapy if someone broke into her house. She was. Mm hmm. She'd frankly, she'd be fucked up. You know what I mean?

**Steven:** Yeah, Melissa was not. not even escape. I don't feel that safe here anymore. I... Nope. Triple bolt doors. No, she didn't she didn't even flinch. And so that was part of my, I manned the house. For two weeks, I didn't sleep. You know, I have videos of myself looking like I'm having fun, but I was swinging weapons that I made in the backyard when my friend came to visit. You know, it's like, I was insane... And she just leave the door unlocked or this and that. And like, you know, and it just was she was just and she could care less about me or, you know, just so so bizarre all of it.

**Mark:** Sure. Yeah. I hope she's doing all right. I mean, Friends and family think I'm crazy. Yeah, you have? Do you have incidental contact with her? like a running.

**Steven:** No, very... Sometimes our last realtor, we had a group chat. You know, this one, I fired that one, and we have a new one. She says to him, I don't to be a part of any group chat. You know, she wants nothing, nothing to do. I make her, I discussed her at such a high level.

**Mark:** Wow.

**Steven:** And the fact that the fact that I said, I'm going to stop paying, was, well, you're disseminating the value of the house you're trying to sell it at below value. And I'm like, I'm out of money. You know, like, I have to sell it low, you know? And so they're putting up a big case against me about how I'm, why I would want to sell the property for less than is worth. I don't know, but it's been like 300 days. I want it, you know, but the thing is, it's like everything is is gets pointed at me. So I'm going to send out, now that I'm my own lawyer, I'm gonna, it's not today tomorrow, release a real banger of a a letter to her lawyer. And her lawyer has to call me and communicate with me, you.

**Mark:** Sure. Great.

**Steven:** But so I'm trying not to let it go to court because if it goes to court, I think I would actually win, but winning is just losing less.

**Mark:** Right.

**Steven:** Someone needs to surrender to win. Do you know what I mean?

**Mark:** Yeah, I have to basically. Yeah. To surrender just means I'm going to align with the opposition that is has a little bit more power in this particular scenario. It's not. There's no winning.

**Steven:** No. You know what I mean? There's no winning. No, I have to. The only way I sense a banger of a thing that her lawyer says we should settle and back out and not go to court is if I have the disability, if I play that card. That's the only way. And I have to not go back to work, anything like that. I get a high paying job, it's over. If I, you know, if I don't play the display card, I will lose, and they take it all, you know, essentially. And so if they've come after it crypto, they've come after everything. I get my Venmo Venmo audited monthly.

**Mark:** Wow.

**Steven:** But now I've stopped complying. You know, it's like, I'm done with it. I'm done. I'm not done anymore. And so there's nothing there. They're fishing around. They think I'm stashing money in different people's pockets to get it back later. They said, she says, who are these big... Who did you pay or three grand to, you, back in this and that? I was like, those were our tenants, that was their security deposit. We issued everything through Venmo, and you should know that. well, you know, so it's stupidity. It's actually just stupidity, but, you know, I'm I'm lingering on a time frame where I have been noncompliant and non responsive. Now the lawyer's out of the way, I have to jump in and ring the bell very aggressively, so I'll do that this afternoon. And then I got to I got a website. I just got off the phone with him and we're going to do a three grand website that's pretty much already done. And so I probably have to get him to not pay me until this is done, too.

**Mark:** Can you just give you cash? Like, old school?

**Steven:** Yeah, he's in Florida, you know, probably he's his business, you know, no. I'll find a way, but I haven't been making money, so I haven't been having to play those games. And so I'm clean in that sense, but I'm I've got a billion ideas, but I'm ready to turn the corner and some really good ideas, but I'm out of funds. I'll be 40 next month and I think about that and I move past it because I know I will move past it.

**Mark:** Okay. You... I really want to challenge you to embrace this notion is the Stoics would say, "Well, there's a bunch, and I'll I'll I'll email them to you." But this is all ephemeral. This is all ephemeral. What's ephemeral? Ephemeral is just temporary. These thoughts are temporary. this. I don't want to say bullshit because it kind of minimized. All this static and quagmire that you're in is finite and temporary. Steven, you're going to be okay. You know what I mean? Like, you, you know, if you want to look at it like an allegory or metaphor, you're you are the Phoenix, you will rise from these ashes. You know, 10, 15, 20 years from now, using that stoic notion of amor fati, this will be a profound opportunity.

**Steven:** It is, I know that I do believe, not to say I know that, but I feel that I have really explored that, I think it's it was a seven year tide that I was in. I've looked to a numerology, I've looked all over the place. The Eagles won the Super Bowl and I met Melissa seven years later, they won the Super Bowl with when we were getting divorced and I...

**Mark:** That is brilliant.

**Steven:** I had to throw that in. That's exactly what it is. It's just part of that. You know, I've been on this Mayan thing, because like I said, I just got got back from Mexico last week, and I just nerded out on Mayan culture, Mayan calendar, Mayan symbolism, Mayan lifestyle, and then, poof, they just disappeared, you know? So it's like, I don't know what happened. But there's something really spiritually profound about all of that stuff.

**Mark:** I love the Mayan history. I'm familiar with it.

**Steven:** Oh, my God. Yeah. And I'm telling you, like, going to Chichen Itza was a game changer. You know, it's really just like, what? How did these people do this? And what? The calendar. The calendar is so sophisticated and, you know, yeah.

**Mark:** Yeah. It's unbelievable. It's amazing. And when I, that's why I challenge you with this notion of all is ephemeral. This is all ephemeral. 500 years from now, is this gonna matter? Is it meaningful? Will anyone be talking about this moment that you and I are having right now? So, because of this notion of all is ephemeral, my challenge, my ask, what I ask of you, Stephen, is, please pursue that, which is meaningful for you. you know, because, you know, life is cruel and brutish and nasty and suffering, and so we must we must pursue that, which is meaningful for us. Not even that which is pleasurable, but that which is meaningful, you know?

**Steven:** Please, please. You had said, talking about the unpleasantness, you said you have your dad's credit card or something?

**Mark:** Yeah. Yeah. And if it's okay, can we look forward and maybe get something a couple weeks from now, if that's okay?

**Steven:** Yeah, I'd like to do it. I mean, two weeks. I mean, I'll be. I would have been having this shit, regardless of whatever legal thing I was in just to put the cards on the table, because my parents had encouraged me to do every two weeks and offered, even though I resisted it. And I also, and this is the part where I'm not familiar. Let me describe something, is any been having trouble getting... It took me a while to get you know, doctors established and all that kind of stuff, but through her leaving and abandoning the healthcare and all stuff like I have had PTSD diagnosed in Florida, although the records are disappointing, it was as convinced as you were. But I don't know when either one of these cases will develop, if they will, and what I I would need for to substantiate validate the way I have.

**Mark:** I'll do it. Steve, I'll do whatever you want. What does that mean? How does that does that have you you had to do or heard of? I've had to testify, I've I've undergone depositions. I'm testifying this Wednesday as an expert witness in a an addictions case involving kratom and overdosing and all that kind of nonsense in a family dispute. If there's specific forms that need to be filled out, or if you need, whatever... When that when that time comes, know that I'm your advocate, okay?

**Steven:** Does that is there a difference between your advocacy and it was like a nurse practitioner of neurology? Is there a, like...

**Mark:** No. You know more than they do, frankly. The nurse practitioner, it just depends on, like, the wheelhouse of, like there' areas of expertise. The nurse practitioner can prescribe medication. That's the difference, you know? But for your four cases, I don't care about that, I guess guess it would be like, if I am who I say I am.

**Steven:** Yeah.

**Mark:** I am what's called I'm certified in ART, which is all trauma based, all trauma related, all trauma care. And it's the highest credential that you can get as an evidence based practice to alleviate the distress associated with trauma.

**Steven:** What's it called? AR?

**Mark:** Which I get ART. I would ask that you find someone close to you up there that can do A.R.T with you. Because it doesn't translate well via telehealth, because it's literally, it involves lateral eye movement, and it involves an actual script, you know, and doing lateral eye movements in this imagery and biofeedback. And it just, again, it doesn't translate well via, I've got to be, I, my preference is to be in the room with the person, so I can read, you know, from nose to toes what's going on.

**Steven:** Okay. I'll look into that. Thank you. But yeah, maybe if you're going to email me any stoic stuff, just I wrote down ART, but anything you have there, because if I'll take this to a lawyer, I might have a new lawyer in both cases soon, and they're going to want to understand the cards of this deck, you know?

**Mark:** Sure, but I want you to know that's I need this to start on a biweekly basis how short of everything.

**Steven:** Yeah. Okay. I need it. You got, um let's see. Let me let me look at something right now. Today's the 19th. We could... Do you want to meet Monday the 2nd? two weeks from now?

**Mark:** Yes. Do you want to meet you want I'm just throwing this out there. You want to meet at noon?

**Steven:** Sure. I have to look at my calendar. And then. So that's the second. and then two weeks after that, could we meet on the 17th? It's actually a Tuesday? At noon at what time? Um, it would be a little bit later in the day. Could we do 1:30?

**Mark:** Sure. Okay. Do those invites come from you?

**Steven:** I'll put them on my calendar. I'll Yeah, I'll take care of everything in my end. I'll send everything to you via email, and invite, text.

**Mark:** Okay. And then two weeks after that, holy cow, we're back in July. We can meet July 1st. Would that be okay?

**Steven:** Sure. Let's start with this. And I could meet you. This is a little bit earlier. Could I meet you at 10:30?

**Mark:** Yeah. Okay. That's a good start. Yeah, I can. As of now, the calendar's cleared. I don't even have to look, but let's just say, if something changes, it'll certainly give you a my job.

**Steven:** Yeah. Absolutely. And I I'm flexible as well. We can pin it, but I just, if I can get it on the calendar and block it out, then it's yours, you know.

**Mark:** So, just to close out, you had said, therapy Fellowship, and what was the third one?

**Steven:** A spiritual practice. A daily spiritual practice.

**Mark:** All right. I have been meditating. That's...

**Steven:** There you go. And the tagline for that, Stephen, is any stone can be a sacred stone.

**Mark:** Ah. Whatever is a spirit, like, I go to the gym. That's a spiritual practice. I walk Gulfport. That's a spiritual practice. If it's intentional with my dog. If you're intentionally practicing.

**Steven:** Absolutely. Yeah.

**Mark:** All right, I remember you saying that, and it clicked with me. So it's a practice is like, you're meaning like a bonsai tree, it's a focus, you know, it's like, you're not just trimming trees, you're practicing. I just, I sent you a message. It It could be petting Lucy, you know?

**Steven:** Yeah.

**Mark:** Okay, I remember that this were resurfacing, which is good. I have to look back at this. I remember this lesson, but I sent you a chat, so look at it. It's got the credit card info.

**Steven:** Where's that? In the chat for this... On this platform. On Headway? Uh, simple practice. Where's simple practice? Where the video is. Let's see. I can email us here. Oh. Oh, I see it. Yeah. Like, what are you doing?

**Mark:** Okay, cool. Um. Okay, so I'm gonna email you just some, you know, stuff to kind of process and chew on and think about, and then we can go from there. The last thing for that credit card sometimes they ask is, do you know the zip code it's attached to?

**Steven:** Yes, 18018.

**Mark:** 118. Okay, 4147, 4041,152, 23, 22, 09291. All right, Stephen. Correct. Courageous and brave. Got twos and get toos, and please pursue that which is meaningful today, and I'll see you in two weeks. If you need anything, you can always text or call or whatever. Yeah, your advocate.

**Steven:** I appreciate you letting me dump on you, and you're good at what you do. I appreciate you, brother.

**Mark:** I appreciate you, Stephen. Oh! I don't know if you're the last thing this has nothing to do with your therapy. So there was a movie that was just released. It was called Jeebus the Movie. J E B U S the Movie. It was all filmed in Gulfport.

**Steven:** Oh, I know this is.

**Mark:** And a lot. The guy's name is Coley. I figured you would know him because he was always part of that courtyard, low tide I heard about Jam.

**Steven:** Yeah. They released it. It's hilarious. If you get a chance, send it to me. who you want to just kind of. I, I know all the guys that filmed that. That's really would be fun to see. Just Google Jeebus the movie. It'll take you right into the website. You can watch it for like three bucks.

**Mark:** Done. It's fantastic. I can't wait. Jeebus the movie.

**Steven:** All right, buddy. Hey, thanks, Mark. That's your homework. That's That's another part of your homework.

**Mark:** I'll take it. I'll look for your email. Thank you.

**Steven:** All right, buddy. I'll see you in. Bye.

**Mark:** Bye. Bye.
