*sad music*

Hey.

*sad music*

Steven, can you hear me?

Wow.

Look at that hair.

I know, right?

Nice.

You're channeling my prior self.

It's my...

I call it my hurricane hair.

Nice.

How is...

I haven't...

Yeah, I haven't had a haircut since pre-hurricane.

And...

I don't want to use your therapy time for all this, but I once went like...

11 years without a haircut.

Like, it was down to my... literally down to my butt.

Like, I could tuck my hair into my pants.

Of course, I was in my 20s and 30s.

So now I'm just trying to see if I can still do it.

I don't know.

Nice.

Looks great.

Yeah, we'll give it...

I'm gonna give it like a year or two and...

You know, my wife likes it, so...

I'm in that weird awkward stage right now.

No.

You look great.

Your hair is all nice and coiffed and this looking all nice.

Although I see a little gray.

I don't think I saw that before.

Well, that whole life will get...

That whole life will do it.

No, I gave myself a haircut.

I was in the town in Maryland that I stay at.

My parents have a place where it's my hideout.

I just...

There's no barber.

It's like a one blinking light town.

And so I cut it not too long ago myself.

You know, not bad.

I got a little bit of feedback on your end.

Let's see.

Yeah.

Do you have an iPhone?

I do.

The feedback's not too bad.

It's really not.

If it's okay on your end, then it's fine.

Yeah.

Yeah, yeah.

We'll let it rip.

If it...

Whatever.

You know, if it gets to a point, we can always FaceTime so long as you're comfortable with that.

Yeah.

No, it's pretty good.

Google...

Okay.

It's cut out pretty good.

But yeah, so I have...

Yeah, I kind of gave you the overview of what was happening.

I think everything is just settled.

I find myself being on edge or edgy around people or scared very easily, like extremely.

If you come up behind me, I have to tell people.

It's not like I turn around and I'm like, karate hands ready to go or anything.

It's hard for people to remember that.

And I feel like it's difficult to relate to what happened.

So I think it's also hard to talk about what happened if you're a parent or something.

Right?

And so I find that being the break in specifically being something that was in the back burner of stuff that I was dealing with.

And while everything else is settled and found its course that hasn't.

And while everything else has settled and found its course that hasn't.

It hasn't.

You know, so I...

Well, it really sounds like textbook post-traumatic stress disorder.

I mean textbook.

Like you're operating from the criteria list, Steve.

And I'm not...

I'm not like...

It's not that I'm relishing it, but I say this from a strengths-based perspective where this is a good thing.

Now you can identify it.

Now you can see it.

Now you can see it.

Especially one of those real key factors.

They call it that heightened startle response.

That is a tremendously large red flag of PTSD.

A heightened startle response.

Where something that...

I don't want to use this phrase, but like under normal circumstances, a person wouldn't, you know, like freak out.

But because of what you experienced, a tremendous violation of your safety.

And at the time, Melissa's as well, right?

You know, it's...

I'll absolutely validate it.

I really will.

The good news is you can work through that.

There's, you know, there's things that...

Although it doesn't always translate via telehealth, you know, like different trauma techniques and things to alleviate the distress, you know?

Yeah.

I think it's all...

I think...

There's the trauma.

Like I guess I'm redefining what trauma is because I imagined it as an acute event, which part of mine was.

If everything else was peachy, that would be the one acute event.

But then there was the...

I would say, you know, the opposite of acute, but it was the sustained trauma of, you know, action and reaction.

Like the break-in was an action reaction, but it was Melissa was a big part of it because I lived on edge because of her frustration with me.

And anything that I did, you know, was...

Would magnify the problem.

And then I would just work all day, get out of the house, and I would try so hard and give all of myself into something that I couldn't pull back and I couldn't get answers on why I couldn't pull it back.

And then she would be mad at me and I wouldn't know why and she wouldn't tell me.

And, you know, she would freak out and, you know, but then she'd pull me back in.

And that was something that she did a lot of is like, pull me back in.

And I have text messages that are like, I'm hesitant to meet you at the pier because it's all of a sudden you're very friendly and I just don't understand it.

And when I get there, it's going to blow up.

And I get it's just like she pull me in, you know, crack me down and then I'd fall back.

Then I pull in a little bit more and I crumble.

And so it became this, you know, and this was all after the break, the break in was March 26, 2024.

Wow.

Yeah, I have, you know, I look at all of our text messages, the pictures we took together, you know, the intimacy that we had, all those things were, you know,

I always said February was the best of 24, the best month of our relationship, you know, January, December.

And we had difficult times, but we also were getting really close through that, you know.

And so when the break in happened, we had everything changed after that, you know, and so a lot of my frustration is because I'm in this, you know, landlord tenant thing.

And still with this landlord from, from down your way.

And, you know, his arrogance around the fact that he didn't have to do anything wasn't obligated to do anything.

But he, you know, he did things like promise me, you know, not saying the word promise, but, you know, hey, I acknowledge that those wooden gates are falling apart.

Let's get you some metal ones.

Would you feel better than yes.

And then I'd go tell Melissa and it would create this atmosphere of I'm taking his name Luther.

I'm taking Luther's word to Melissa.

And then she's calling me a man.

I'm not a man of my word because those things aren't done.

And I am.

Oh, wow.

And then so I'd go back to Luther.

And I would say, oh, yeah.

Also, like there's motion lights that are not working.

Then there's like, what else was there?

Oh, we don't have there's no everyone else has security cameras.

We don't, you know, and he would lead me on to think things were getting done.

And then I'd finally hear back after not acknowledging.

He would say, like, you can install your those cameras, but just no drilling.

And then that would be it.

He wouldn't.

You know, it was it was.

And so I find myself extremely angry at him for that.

Sure.

Because, you know, when I look back at all the messages and when going through divorce and then going through this tenant landlord tenant dispute, I've relived all these text messages and everything over and over again.

And I can just I could just very clearly see.

Now, I'm not looking for a place to put the anger and take it out on somebody for the sake of that.

I'm trying to find answers in resolving myself first and deciding if I want to pursue anything with him.

And I'm still undecided, but I've gotten a bit obsessed as well with this case of what I have against him, because as I've taken my anger and relived all these things and then had to go back and for the divorce.

Pull up the lease and go through all this stuff.

I started to see these irregularities in the lease and I started to.

Sure.

You know, I'm a really good sleuther.

And so I start to look into this, like, why did he put the address in Gulfport as the landlord address five times?

You know, where's he?

And then he changed after one month's, you know, move in cost.

He changed.

He said, oh, he wrote us a package.

He said, here's eight pre addressed envelopes, pre stamped.

Send your rent checks to a Marlowe Enterprises in North Carolina.

And so we just in good faith started sending our rent checks to this company in North Carolina.

You know, and then I start looking.

I don't know the law.

And so I now have like a lawyer, a lawyer's level of knowledge around landlord tenant law, but that you can't.

Let's just say you can't do that.

And the company.

Okay.

Yeah.

You know, the company is also not approved to do business in Florida.

And then I just recently uncovered the fact that it's not actually a business.

It's a shell name that he filed in North Carolina.

And it's all to it's all tax fraud.

And he's actually a part of quite a big web of individuals who coordinate and buy and sell real estate to each other.

And they're all in on it.

And so I'm living this crime.

It's actually entertaining for me and more healthy.

Okay.

And more healthy.

That's a strength based perspective.

You know, I waited until April 15th before I was going to do something.

I still haven't because April 15th I knew he'd file his taxes and not report on the income.

And I wrote him $36,000 to his company in North Carolina.

And so I can get I can take this to court and, you know, he also, you know, breach of habitability.

You can't say, you know, there was a security issues.

There's no locks.

There's no this or that.

And like, and he didn't do anything.

We had a clogged sink.

He didn't even respond.

Like this guy is awful is a terrible landlord.

So, you know, he kept my whole security deposit and $4,200 of my personal belongings and then blocked me from getting it.

Yeah.

And then blocked me from getting it.

I was there out front.

And so him and the realtor were, you know, working it together.

And both the realtor was just like Luther told me to stop community, cease communication, you know.

And so these two men who were, you know, my, I communicated with them throughout the lease all friendly.

You know, I let the landlord know, I said, hey, I got PTSD from that event.

You know about it.

I moved out two days late because of a storm on Labor Day.

My movers bailed.

Melissa wasn't there to help me.

I stayed.

I stayed two days after the lease.

And so he, you know, disclosed that and there's lots of laws around their responsibilities.

And so, you know, I've got a really big case if I want to go after Compass Realty, the realtor and this guy who's from Florida, who's a lawyer.

He's also a lawyer and he's also sits on committees for like, you know, lawyers and ethics and all this stuff.

So, yeah, for the Supreme Court of Missouri, too, it's like, you know, so when you look at punitive damages, like a multiplier of damages, it's like if you egregious and premeditated, it's really hard to prove.

But like, you know, I don't need a lawyer to tell me that this case has all the multipliers in it.

You know, at least the lease is, you know, null and void, in my opinion.

I just went back basically all the money that I paid his defunct company or his non-existent company.

Right.

But I also want to ring the justice bell.

And this guy treats tenants like this all over the place.

He walked all over it.

I was going to say.

Yeah.

Yeah.

He's doing it to you.

He's doing it to everyone else.

Oh, and he's so full of shit.

Yeah.

And he's just a awful person.

And he knows, you know, all day he's sitting there listening to how lawyers are breaking the law.

It's like he watches so much of the same show.

He knows how to do it.

All this.

He's genius.

I go into all his deeds, all his records.

I mean, I've gotten everything.

How he bought that house was illegal.

Like, you know, and I have all this information and it's a powerful position to be in.

And I'm deciding what I want to do to it.

And I'm going to take him to the bar associations that he's in.

I'm going to IRS, like everything.

Yeah.

It'll bring down his house.

But I also, you know, I can't do it unless there's a financial end to that.

Because it's, I have hundreds of hours into this.

I'm not even kidding you.

I'm actually, you know, on the, one of the reasons I am.

And one of the reasons I've been able to find all these things is I've been building a product.

That's fine.

Technology to help people represent themselves pro se in these types of.

Yeah.

So that's the reason why I've been spending so much time.

Um, and I'm also the, uh, the opportunity behind the crisis.

And with Melissa, I fired my attorney.

So I'm pro se attorney on record for myself.

And that, um, as of last week.

Wow.

Yeah.

I saw that in your email.

I read your, I read your email, but then, then I, I forced myself.

Oh, losing you.

Preconceived notions.

I want to be tainted.

I wanted to, I wanted to get your perspective and get your perceptions.

Um, what is the present status of your marriage?

Like, is it, is your marriage been dissolved?

I mean, is there, what's, what's going on?

It's so funny to hear that question.

I used to hear you ask that question and it was, you know, I would, I had a response of good and bad.

Um, right.

Yeah, no, it's, um, it's, uh, how many months are we in now?

It's taken forever.

Our property that we own together in, um, Philly is, hasn't sold yet, which is just absolutely destroyed me financially.

Cause I've been paying, you know, 3,500 bucks a month.

And she has just, you know, decided not to pay.

Um, and so I've decided that I'm going to stop paying because I'm so financially stressed and have such a, you know, I paid for six months while it was vacant.

And she just told me to fuck you.

And now I'm getting blamed for reducing the price, you know?

And, um, you know, so I'm getting, it's not making a whole lot of sense, but, um, you know, the house is bringing the condo is bringing me under, um, I'm going to let it.

It's going into its second month as of like today of non-payment.

Um, I'll let it go to foreclosure unless it sells.

And then we get a little pop, but, um, I'm getting blamed for it all.

But also the only way that I have a chance of, um, fighting back in this divorce is because I got diagnosed with PTSD and she abandoned, you know, she got a job and then she left without telling me.

I found out I didn't have insurance anymore, you know?

And so she, she, you know, it's medical abandonment and financial abandonment.

And then she went and got a job in December and she should have told me because I'm eligible to be on her benefits, but I'm paying for the Maryland exchanges right now.

And, um, you know, so I, I really feel like I'm blamed and I blame myself, but I don't know why, because I've never learned from her why.

Um, but then I stepped back and I realized how twisted my mind has gotten to even think that when I think of her abandonment, um, of all these things.

So, you know, um, it's not going well, but it doesn't weigh on me.

I've accepted that it could foreclose.

I'm essentially washed myself out financially.

Um, you know, I, the only way I don't give her two years of alimony is if I file for social security disability.

Um, my lawyer, that was their main lawyers was the main thing was, is you should file.

You really need to file because I haven't worked.

I've lost consulting gigs that haven't paid because I'm mentally struggling.

Um, sure.

I've lost three clients since that break in and I haven't made a dime.

Um, you know, I work every day and work, I'm progressing things.

It takes me forever to do something.

Um, and I'm starting to come around to, am I filing to file and using that card to fight?

Or is it, am I actually suffering from all the trauma that was acute and non-acute?

Um, and how much is it my fault, Melissa's fault or the landlord?

You know, and so I find myself developing, um, self grief, um, self blame, and then attributing

a lot of it to the, the, you know, the landlord would have really affected their relationship

stuff the landlord didn't do.

That's the, that's one of the big issues, you know, where I, where I start to put my

anger in this and I just, uh, I want to get past it.

You know, if I go down that route with the landlord, that could be two years of reliving

it, you know?

All right.

So I'm in, I'm in this, what's the cost, you know, but it also could be closure and it

could be, you know, as my dad puts it like, you know, a punching bag to, um, where I'm

in control.

I I'm, I'm so sweet.

I'm so sweet.

I'm excited when I talk about it, I'm developing a product out of this for in legal tech and

applying AI.

And it's fascinating what I've been able to build and learn, you know?

So it's like to see it all the way through would give me such a bird's eye view of like

the person I'm building this for.

So maybe I, maybe I pursue it in that spirit, but I'm not gold digging.

Um, his liability is so high with this that it's tempting to look at it like that, but I

don't expect to get a dime from it.

You know, it's one of those things, but it could be a historic case in Florida.

And I kid you not.

People think I'm crazy when I say that.

Um, there's, there's no case.

It sounds ridiculous.

I don't think you're crazy.

I don't think you're crazy at all.

There's no case.

There's crazy.

I was just gonna say Florida has never seen a case like this.

Never had a break in never had, you know, all these things that are wild, um, took place.

There's cases around the state that have bits and pieces of it, strong bits and pieces, but

I've got them all.

I've got them all.

And then this, I'm covering this, you know, multi-state scheme.

He's a part of is just wild.

And so without all the details, um, I'm, I sit down to work and I, um, spin and I have a

block in my head that doesn't allow me to do what I need to do.

And I get lost in doing the things that I shouldn't do.

And I watch myself do it.

I watch myself do it.

Um, I'm extremely unproductive.

Yeah.

Well, what, let me ask you this.

You say you're unproductive, but yet it's not like you're laying in bed all day long, right?

Like you're getting up, you're suiting up, you're showing up.

What is the, if, if you say you're not being productive, well then what does being productive

mean or look like?

It's around for me, it's like task management, project management.

It's like, uh, being organized to see like the path, the roadmap ahead of what I need to

do and when.

Um, and when I go in, I go to this really nice hotel around the corner, this town I'm in where I grew up.

Uh, just got like the nicest main street in, in the U S or something.

But I walked to this main street, they got this hotel lobby.

I go to, it's beautiful.

And I'll, I sat there for 10 hours yesterday and I knew what?

Yeah.

Yeah.

I mean, in and out, you know, I walk in and out, but it was a 10 hour block.

Um, you know, and I have like two things that I really need to do.

Um, and you know, the, the good advice my mom will give her.

Someone's like, Oh yeah.

Like give yourself the reward afterwards and go do those things.

And, and, but for whatever reason, my, my mind stops me from doing it.

You know, I get lost in finding it in the app store, you know, in a new app or going into

the settings of a new app or new tool or this, that, and I want, and I know what I'm doing

it and I let myself do it.

And I, it's almost like doing something to forward myself and, you know, what would it

look like?

It would be like a very good detailed plan of all the projects and the tasks within and all

the things I need to do.

And, you know, pull my mom and she's offered to help and just say, Hey, like we have to tackle

these things.

Um, but in tackling those things, it's looking at a lot of things in, you know, the eyes.

And I think that's where I struggle is I'm so tired of it all.

It's been a nonstop battle since Florida started and I lost, I got fired and I lost my brother-in-law

and sister because I worked for the company down there.

And that was December of 23 is when that all happened.

And it was a battle leading up to when I got there in like August of 23.

And so it just, it's finally settled from a day to day.

Um, but the, the remnants are still there and I have to face it.

So there was, you were starting to enter into litigation against your, was it your sister

and your brother-in-law?

Right.

My sister was married and brother-in-law was a partner and I was a partner and they, my,

you know, she was just in the outskirts, but they, they lied to us, you know, pull the rug

out in terms of insurance when we got down there, lowered my, I mean, cut my salary down tremendously.

Didn't have the money.

They told me, yeah, I stopped.

I pulled that back.

I'm not pursuing that legally.

Okay.

So that is done.

That is that case is closed, so to speak.

Are, are you at a level of acceptance as it pertains to that?

Yeah.

I'm okay with that one.

Doesn't like, yeah, that one was really a sad one because I don't see my niece and nephew

anymore.

And, you know, it's really, when I think about that, it's really sad.

Uh, it's, it's, you know, she calls my dad on his birthday and there's this awkwardness,

you know, it does not like we all used to get on FaceTime and everything anymore.

It's, it's since that month, but my parents are aligned with me.

They just keep it to ourselves.

And, uh, my sister made some poor decisions.

So did he.

Um, so it's nice to have their support and what happened.

Okay.

Yeah.

Okay.

That was my question.

Like what's the, what's the familial aftermath as a result of this?

Uh, like the relationship between you and your sister, is it just non-existent at this point?

Yeah.

I don't know.

Yeah.

And their kids too.

So it's, um,

that's a bummer.

Yeah.

That is a bummer.

Yeah.

So that I feel sad about the outcome.

I don't reminisce about a whole lot about what happened.

I mean, I do, but you know, I've got other, the other stuff wins.

I don't, you know, uh, it's the break and it's the divorce.

I mean, those are, it's, uh, the landlord, you know, those are, um, you know, the things

on edge.

I feel calm today, I think cause I was coming into this session.

Um, good, but I'm glad you reached out.

That's brave.

Yeah.

Yeah.

And I'm not, I'm not implying that you dodged a bullet by no means, but like, and I don't

say this to be coy, like you, like the hurricanes would have been the absolute knockout punch

for your trauma.

Had you stayed down there.

It was horrifying.

I can't imagine.

I wish I was there.

Honestly.

After, after all happened, I just, I know what you mean though.

Yeah.

Like just out of a communal sense.

Yeah.

I mean, have you been back?

When was the last time you were in the city of Gulfport?

I left in, um, September of 2014.

September of 24.

Right before the hurricanes.

Oh, right before, right before.

Yeah.

I didn't, they were, they were, I got a text message on my drive or something like, um, you

know, coming back and then I followed it.

So I was getting back.

I drove all the way up, um, rented a car and all that stuff.

Wow.

Yeah.

So I had, I just felt for you guys so much, but yeah, you know what?

Um, um, that could have, that could have been, you know, especially about a home or,

you know, stuff like that.

I would have, um, it must've been just so tough for everybody down there.

Yeah.

Well, it's a lot losing.

You know, like living out of a garbage bag, you know, just Airbnb.

So in that respect, from a strength based perspective, you, you dodged that bullet, you know, which

given the series of hits that you were enduring with the trauma, the breaking and entering, and

then you and Melissa and the micro trauma after micro trauma, I can only imagine the psychological

state that you would have been in post hurricane.

Had you been down here?

You know what I mean?

Like, yeah, I was, I mean, I was in a spiral on my drive back.

I was in a spiral.

I mean, it took me almost 10 days to get back.

I was late with my car.

It was late.

I had to rent a big car, you know, cause Melissa took my car and, um, you know, and I just, I

just remember being like three days late on that.

And just like the bill was like a thousand bucks extra.

And because I just, I was like spinning, I was just trying to like slide into home and then

deal with the aftermath.

But I couldn't get through the day of driving some days.

I was just so tired one day.

One day I went down, I just pulled into a parking lot at a gas station in the middle of nowhere

and just literally slept for two and a half days.

And Lucy was with me.

So I get her out and stuff, but it was like, you know, I had an excursion.

So, you know, I ended up ditching a lot of my stuff and I just slept in the back of this

thing.

And, um, wow.

Oh yeah.

I got, um, yeah, I just, I stayed in a dirty hotel just to, just to sleep, you know?

Um, but I was also, um, just spinning the whole time.

I didn't really stop spinning until, you know, maybe a few months ago, even when I was calm

through the winter, I was in middle of nowhere by myself a lot, which was good.

Um, but no, with no structure or direction either.

I would just work on what I'm working on and push off the important stuff and just try to

hide.

It was literally hiding, literally hiding.

Right.

And I still feel like I'm doing that.

Okay.

Yeah.

Yeah.

So, you know, and if I haven't brought this up in the previous session, then I'm bringing

it up right now, you know, the evidence-based three-prong approach to sustained change, right?

I'm trying to facilitate some kind of change.

Uh, let's say I'm an, I'm an alcoholic.

I'm active in my addiction and I want to embrace recovery, right?

I want to, I want to live a life of abstinence and I want to recover the three-prong approach,

or I have, um, uh, uh, either a chronic trauma that I've been dealing with or an acute trauma,

or dare I say a complex trauma, which is to say that it doesn't go away and it affects

all senses.

The three-prong approach, Steve, is one something therapeutic, whatever that is.

You got to do something therapeutic.

In a perfect world, you see a therapist.

It's what you're doing right now.

So you can check that off the list.

The second prong of that, this, and these are big, big, broad umbrellas.

The second prong is fellowship, you know, something.

And I, I wonder, do you have fellowship?

Do you have a tribe?

Do you have a posse?

Um, whatever that is for some, again, using the, the analogy of the alcoholic, well, they

go to AA, you know, like that's what they do.

They go to AA and that's their fellowship.

For some people it's their neighborhood.

For some people it's the church.

For some people it's a, I don't know, some organization, some fraternal organization, the

Moose Lodge.

I don't know.

Or the corner pub.

You know, I, I have little pockets of that.

Uh, when I go to Philly, sometimes I stay at my condo and, um, you know, the, the bartender

is here or there and things like that.

I feel that as I do my rounds.

Cause everybody remembers me and I get to see them and I click into that, but, um, it's not

a, I wouldn't call a tribe.

Um, you know, in each town, I kind of have little pockets, but it's scattered and I leave.

And then I go, I'm rotating like three places right now, mine.

And then my parents have a real small place near the water and the Chesapeake Bay.

And then here in Bethlehem where we grew up.

Um, you know, so I just kind of bounce around.

And so anything that's a tribe, nobody misses me when I'm gone or notices.

It's not like that.

I feel like I'm more, um, I'm, I'm, when I go out, I talk to people.

I mean, I, you know, make conversation with everyone.

Um, on the face of it, I, it feels like a relief for me to do that, to ham it up with, you know,

make some jokes and stuff like that.

And then when I sit down, but when I sit down, I'm depressed and was, you know, when I think

about who I was at that register and you know, how almost how fake it was, but also like,

it was like a relief just because they don't know me.

I don't know them.

And, or if we do know each other, it's just through that register experience.

And, um, it's a nice relief from myself, frankly.

Um, so I don't feel like it's like fraudulent, but no, I don't have a, I've had that tight

group.

I've been on teams and I've been on all that stuff.

Right.

Um, uh, I feel I'm way more of a loner.

Um, I'm unresponsive to friends a lot.

Um, as well.

You still got your buddy in Austin.

I talked to him all the time.

Yeah.

Yeah.

And I friend from Gulfport, who was a really a true friend who really came to visit me in

we, he stayed at the condo and, you know, completely empty condo couch and a bed, but

we had a blast.

Um, one of my, yeah, one of my best friends.

And I even find myself sometimes just taking a break from him because he's very, uh, wants

to help a lot.

And sometimes I don't want help or I don't want to talk about it, you know?

Right.

And, um, he's such a good helper.

That's what he does.

He's a shepherd for people and I'm blessed to have him as a friend.

But, um, you know, I find myself, um, introverted far more than I used to be.

But I also love being by myself.

I have, I find good company in myself.

Yeah.

Okay.

That's the next, you know, part of my session prep is.

And be around you alone and being lonely.

Do you find yourself like, how would you describe that?

Are you lonely?

Like, do you yearn?

No.

For human contact?

Or are you like yearning for intimacy?

And I'm not just talking about like having sex or anything like that.

I mean, like the warm body, you know, the human contact, the actual intimacy.

You know, um, my mom and dad are huggers.

Um, I hug my mom when I, when I see her in the morning.

Sometimes I'm with my dad for a week or so.

And sometimes my mom, they're together, but there's go back and they, you know, go in different

directions.

Um, sure.

The tennis stuff.

So I'll stay sometime with my dad.

And then sometimes my mom, sometimes we're all together.

Um, and we get along really well.

And, you know, hug, you know, so I get, um, my mom's the best hugger in the league, you know, so I, I get that.

You know, I get that.

You know, I get that.

Um, and, you know, I get that.

Um, and, you know, I get that, you know, I get that.

Um, and, you know, I get that.

Um, and, you know, I get that.

Um, and, you know, I get that.

And, you know, I get that.

Yeah.

I get that.

So I, I get that.

You know, we, we talk about, you know, 20 seconds.

You kind of get that dopamine.

So we count for fun sometimes.

So it's like, you know, and then I have their dog and, you know, we lost a dog recently, but,

um, you know, all that kind of, um, and then Lucy, my dog.

So, I mean, I hug my dog.

Like she's in the other room.

Um, Oh, okay.

So you got her there.

Yeah.

So, I mean, I, that dog is a, you know, a daughter, but like, I mean, there's not, uh,

there's no, uh, and she's just has been through me, everything I described in the car.

I mean, the whole way I, and I took her, um, and had to make, you know, a move because Melissa

was going to take her.

Um, you know, and so she's my dog and I took her, but I have a lot of guilt around that too.

Um, and, uh, but Lucy's my, you know, saving grace.

I mean, that dog has been everything for me.

So I hug her like all day.

I mean, she's true.

And I got her as a service dog.

Um, you know, easy, not hard to do a PDS.

It's kind of an easy one of the group to do it, but I also did it.

So she wouldn't, Melissa wouldn't make a case and take, say, I couldn't take care of myself.

She was starting to say, I can't take care of myself.

I can't take care of a dog.

I mean, that's starting to question your competency, Steve.

Yes.

That's what's the, so the, her and her lawyers, her lawyers, um, that's what they're coming

at.

I get that all the time.

I mean, it's, um, so if I, a lot of things, but you're not a competent.

Yeah.

So if I like you're a lot, yeah.

Part of being pro se and representing myself is that if I do it very competently, I then hurt

my case for the disability that I've endured and my inability to work.

I frankly haven't gone out to get a job because I've been advised if I can sustain myself,

not to, because if I get a job, the disability is out the window and I'm going to pay a two

years alimony and they're going to watch 2024 and they're going to look at the years they

want and do that.

So I, it's like, I, I can't, but I also can't like, I just, I can't, you know?

So I'm in this like, um, imposter syndrome, such an imposter syndrome because people in my

corner, we all know that I'm kind of not getting a job.

My parents are helping me.

My dad's, I have a card for you to give to you today because they encourage this and, uh,

we're going to pay for it.

And so, but it's an awful feeling to accept that help.

I've got a round on it, but, um, you know, I have to play the disability card because otherwise

the female wins, man.

It's just how it goes.

And my cards are stacked against me.

Um, so I have to file for disability.

I probably have to get somebody like yourself.

Uh, I got diagnosed, but my, uh, paperwork, the report says could be a PDS acute or it could

be something else.

And it's not clear.

And so it's like, as I'm putting all the other stuff to file, I'm like, I don't even

know if I have enough, but Melissa was in the room when that woman was as convinced as you

were that it was PDSD.

And I can tell you that it is.

Um, let's, let's cognitively diffuse it.

Why wouldn't it be?

It is.

I mean, yeah.

It's like, you know, um, like that's it.

If we, if we look at it, you know, we cognitively diffuse it.

Like why wouldn't it?

Yeah.

Yeah.

I mean, just that isolated event, a home invasion, man, you know, like, God, and I, like nothing

happened.

Like, like, Oh, that was just old drunk Billy.

Yeah, exactly.

You know, Melissa's family is fairly, you know, I think connected or kind of, you know,

and so it's been suspicion that they were behind her.

Melissa knew about it just because, so I start to go down this path of like paranoia where,

you know, I've really, I've really thought about this a lot and it's a hard, I won't pull

this card ever because to pull it and miss is terrible.

Um, but her reaction to that day and that event was so neutral and bizarre that.

Wow.

It just seems so weird.

I, you know, hashed out all the everything, but I, I have so much time to think about this.

It just seems, you know, I didn't see her going to some street gang and, you know, pulling a

guy and, you know, paying them on the side.

I'm on the side, but her family is the kind that called into the state of Florida and got

me moved to where I needed to see people under the insurance that we had.

It was a year wait for some of the stuff that I did.

And I got it quick because of that.

You know, I don't, I don't know who made those calls, but they have a lot of doctors, a lot

of, you know, this or that.

So, um, could they have, uh, they wanted me to roll over and take all these medicine and

medications and come back to Pennsylvania.

And I, and I, we, I wanted to fight.

I wanted to stay, you know, and then it all fell apart.

And so they, that could have happened.

So I lived that life of contemplating that.

Like, and again, I don't want to go down the supposition rabbit hole, but are you implying

that in, in some way, shape or form that Melissa's family could have, I don't know, had an influence

in this guy breaking into the house?

It's possible.

You know, I look at a text.

And shit, anything's possible.

I was just in Mexico in a place called Chichen Itza, the Mayan ruins.

There's a theory that aliens abducted everyone, that they all got aboard the mothership and

they all disappeared.

I can't disprove it.

Hell, it could, it's possible.

It could have happened.

I don't know.

Melissa's parents could have pulled some strings and gotten some drunk yokel, local yokel knucklehead

just to terrorize you.

Yeah.

Somebody held something over them and said, you know, go to this place or something.

And Melissa sent me a text message two days, three days before it happened.

And it was a screenshot of a saying that said, you know, 3:00 AM is the hour of like workers

and artists or something.

And it was 3:00 AM, three days later.

You know, it just, if I had to place a bet, I would say no.

Right.

So I don't want to get too caught up on that.

Right.

Because it's just so ridiculous.

Right.

But the, no one has gotten a stranger response.

And I, there was no, nothing.

No one's ever beaten up the guy who came into his house and in front of his wife and gotten

less than I have.

Like there was no, there was no thank you.

There was no anything.

Yeah.

No, there was nothing.

Mike.

Yeah.

And this is, this is an unfair question and I'm just kind of putting it into the cosmos.

How come Melissa doesn't have trauma as a result of this?

I'm just, you know, I'm, I'm none.

It's not fair, but I'm, I'm personalizing your situation where I'm thinking how my wife

would react given her emotional comportment.

She'd be in therapy if someone broke into our house, she would, she'd be, she'd frankly,

she'd be fucked up.

You know what I mean?

Like Melissa would not, not even.

I don't feel like there anymore.

You know, like I, I, I'm no triple bolt the door.

No, she, she didn't feel, she didn't even flinch.

And so that was part of my, I'm, I manned the house for two weeks.

I didn't sleep.

You know, I have, I have videos of myself look like I'm having fun, but I was swinging weapons

that I made in the backyard.

My friend came to visit, you know, it's like I was insane.

Yeah.

And she just, um, leave the door unlocked or this or that.

And like, you know, and it just was a care.

She was just, and she could care less about me or, you know, I just, so bizarre.

All of it.

Um, sure.

Yeah.

I hope she's doing all right.

I mean, friends and family think I'm crazy.

Yeah.

Do you have, do you have incidental contact with her?

Do you have like a running?

No, it very, sometimes our last realtor, we had a group chat.

Um, you know, this one, I fired that one and we have new one.

Uh, she says to him, I don't want to be a part of any group chat.

Um, you know, she wants nothing, nothing to do.

I make her, I discussed her at such a high level.

Um, and, and, and the fact that the fact that I said, I'm going to stop paying, um, rent was,

uh, well, you're disseminating the value of the house.

You're trying to sell it at below value.

And I'm like, I'm out of money.

I, you know, like I have to sell it low, you know?

And so they're putting up a big case against me about how I'm, why I would want to sell a

property for less than it's worth.

Um, I don't know, but it's been like 300 days.

I want, you know, I want to sell it.

Um, I want to sell it.

Um, I want to sell it.

Um, I want to sell it.

I want to sell it.

Um, I want to sell it.

I want to sell it.

Um, I want to sell it.

Um, I want to sell it.

Um, I want to sell it.

I have to sell it low, you know?

And so they're putting up a big case against me about how I'm, why I would want to sell

a property for less than it's worth.

Um, I don't know, but it's been like 300 days.

I want, you know, but the thing is, it's like everything is, um, is, is, gets pointed at,

at me.

So I'm going to send out now that I'm my own lawyer, I'm going to, it's not today, tomorrow

release a real banger of a letter to her lawyer.

And her lawyer has to call me and communicate with me now.

So.

Sure.

Um, great.

But so I'm trying not to let it go to court because, uh, if it goes to court, I think

I would actually win.

Um, but winning is just losing less.

Right.

Someone needs to surrender to win.

You know what I mean?

Like I have to basically.

Yeah.

I surrender just means I'm going to align with the, the opposition that is, has a little bit

more power in this particular scenario.

It's not, there's no winning.

No.

I mean, there's no winning.

No, I have to, I, the only way I sense a banger of a thing that her lawyer says we should

settle and back out and not go to court is if I, if I have the disability.

Um, if I play that card, that's the only way.

Right.

And I have to not go back to work and you know, anything like that.

I get a high paying job.

It's over.

If I, um, you know, if I don't play the disability card, I will lose.

And, um, they, and they take it all, you know, essentially.

And so they've come after it.

Crypto.

They've come after everything.

I've got, I get my Venmo audited, Venmo audited monthly.

Wow.

But now I've stopped complying.

Yeah.

You know, it's like, I'm done with it.

I'm done.

I'm not doing it anymore.

Um, and so there's nothing there.

They're fishing around.

They think I'm stashing money in different people's pockets to get it back later.

They said, she says, who, who are these big offshore?

They came.

Who did you pay?

Who did you pay five or a three grand to, you know, back in this and that.

I was like, those were our tenants.

That was their security deposit.

We issued everything through Venmo and you should know that.

You know, so it's, it's stupidity.

It's actually just stupidity, but, um, you know, I'm, I'm lingering on a timeframe where

I have been non-compliant and non-responsive.

Now that lawyers out of the way, um, I have to jump in and, um, ring the bell very aggressively.

So I'll do that this afternoon.

Um, and then I got, I got a website.

Um, yeah, I just got off the phone with them and we're going to do a three grand website.

It's pretty much already done.

And, um, so I probably have to get him to not pay for me.

I'm going to get him to not pay me until this is done too.

Okay.

Just give you cash.

Like old school.

Yeah.

He's in Florida, you know, probably he's his business, you know, now.

Um, I'll find, I'll find a way, but I haven't been making money.

So I haven't been, um, having to play those games.

And so I'm clean in that sense, but I'm, I've got a billion ideas, but, um, I'm ready to turn

the corner.

Um, and some really good ideas, but I'm out of funds.

Um, I'll be 40 next month.

And I think about that and I can move past it because I know I will move past it.

Okay.

You're the, I, I really want to challenge you to embrace this notion as the Stoics would say,

well, there's a bunch and I'll, I'll email them to you, but this is all ephemeral.

This is all ephemeral.

What's the ephemeral?

Ephemeral is just temporary.

These thoughts are temporary.

This, this, I don't want to say bullshit because it kind of minimized all this static and quagmire

that you're in is finite and temporary.

Steven, you're going to be okay.

You know what I mean?

Like you, you know, you want to look at it like an allegory or metaphor.

You are the Phoenix.

You will rise from these ashes, you know, 10, 15, 20 years from now using that stoic notion of amor fati.

This will be a profound opportunity.

It is.

I know that I do.

I do believe not to say I know that, but I, I feel that I have really explored that.

Um, I think it's a, it was a seven year tide that I was in.

I've, I've looked to numerology.

I've looked all over the place.

Uh, the Eagles won the Superbowl when I met Melissa seven years later, they won the Superbowl when we were getting divorced.

And I, you know,

I had to throw that in exactly what it is.

It's just part of that.

You know, I've been on this Maya thing.

Cause like I said, I just got back from Mexico last week and I just nerded out on my culture, my encounter, my symbolism, my lifestyle.

And then poof, they just disappeared, you know?

So it's like, I don't know what happened.

Uh, but there's something really spiritually profound about all of that stuff.

And I love the Mayan history.

All that.

I'm familiar with it.

Oh my God.

Yeah.

Yeah.

And I'm telling you, like going to Chichen Itza was a game changer.

You know, it's really just like, what, how do these people do this?

The calendar, the calendar is so sophisticated and you know, yeah.

Yeah.

It's amazing.

And when I, that's why I challenge you with this notion of all is ephemeral.

This is all ephemeral.

500 years from now, is this going to matter?

Is it meaningful?

Will anyone be talking about this moment that you and I are having right now?

So because of this notion of all is ephemeral, my challenge, my ask, what I ask of you, Steven,

is please pursue that which is meaningful for you, you know?

Because, you know, life is cruel and brutish and nasty and suffering.

And so we must, we must pursue that which is meaningful for us.

Not even that which is pleasurable, but that which is meaningful, you know?

Okay.

Please, please.

Um, you had said, uh, talking about the unpleasantness.

You said you have your dad's credit card or something?

Yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah.

And if it's okay, can we look forward and maybe get something a couple of weeks from now,

if that's okay?

Yeah.

I'd like to do it.

I mean, two weeks.

I mean, I'll be, um, I would have been having this shirt regardless of whatever legal thing

I was in just to put the cards on the table.

Um, because my parents encouraged me to do every two weeks and offered, even though I resisted

it.

Um, and I, and I also, and I'm, this is the part where I'm not familiar.

Let me just grab something.

Um, is, uh, any, um, been having trouble getting, it took me a while to get, um, you know, doctors

were established and all that kind of stuff, but through, uh, her leaving and abandoning

the healthcare and all stuff like I have had PDSD diagnosed in Florida, although the records

are disappointing.

It was as, as convinced as you were.

Um, but I don't know when, um, either one of these cases will develop if they will and what

I would need for, to substantiate and validate that what I have.

I'll do it.

Steve, I'll do whatever you want.

Steve, I appreciate you letting me dump on you.

And you're good at what you do.

I appreciate you, brother.

I appreciate you, Steven.

This has nothing to do with your therapy.

So there was a movie that was just released.

It was called Jeebus the Movie.

J-E-B-U-S, the Movie.

It was all filmed in Gulfport.

Oh, I know this.

And a lot of...

The guy's name is Coley.

I figured you would know him because he was always part of that courtyard, low-tide scene.

I heard about Jeebus.

Yeah.

They finally released it.

It's hilarious.

Oh, please send it to me.

If you get a chance...

Please send it to me.

I know all the guys that filmed that.

That really would be fun to see.

Just Google Jeebus the Movie.

It'll take you right to the website.

You can watch it for like three bucks.

Done.

It's fantastic.

I can't wait.

Jeebus the Movie.

All right, buddy.

Hey, thanks, Mark.

That's your homework.

That's another part of your homework.

I'll take it.

I'll look for your email.

Thank you.

All right, buddy.

I'll see you in a bit.

Bye.

Bye.

Welcome back to earth, Jeebus.

Where am I?

Go.

Forage, Florida.

Interesting choice.

The same thing that's going on in the whole world is going on in this little beach table.

It should be funnier than the first go-round.

Hopefully I don't end up dead at the end.

God says I'm good boy.

My Jeebus.

Look what they're doing.

I just said love.

They're canceled.

It's like people forgot how to love.

Man, that's what God was saying.

Welcome to the church of yes.

I'm sure you're all tired of the church of no.

You're special.

You're special.

Yeah.

You're special.

You're special.

No, no.

They're got it all wrong.

Yes.

Yes.

The Bi-Phone 12 came out with pansexuals.

They bang pants?

I want to help, but at the same time, I'm kind of, you know, the rules of the game is

that you're supposed to have free will.

So this whole world is you doing what you want to do.

I think I'm becoming a white inferiorist.

Yeah, you guys are awful.

Yeah.

Yeah.

I just think we're becoming worse.

Yeah.

I mean, I didn't think it could get worse than colonialism, but...

I feel like this was a generation of generations.

I've been beating it down with you.

The second you think your ideas are so important you can hurt somebody, it's the second those

ideas have lost their relevance.

That's for God.

Whatever the fuck it is.

Mansplainer.

The earth is burning.

I wish I had a holocaust.

So I do.

This surviving season.

Ugly business.

I sleep safer knowing I got all these guns.

A little bit.

I don't really know what they stand for, but they use short words and small sentences

that a man like me can understand.

Just violence, really?

Like murder?

I know climate change and pollution are real problems.

I just don't care.

I hate to say it, but there's a lot of idiots down there.

A little sign.

Something.

Something that left me all on my life.

What does God have to do?

What does God have to do with me?

Cut his fucking balls off!

I know, he's being crucified right now, but I think we should talk about both sides.

Yeah, I mean, it's tough things, but we should unify instead of dividing.

I can't see dividing help in this.

It certainly has sucked lately, right?

It was supposed to be so simple.

Come down, go to court.

We're going to have a big old erection.

She means we're going to have an insurrection.

So come out to the insurrection.

I'm going to have a big old erection.

I'm going to have a big old erection.

I'm going to have a big old erection.

I'm going to have a big old erection.

I'm going to have a big old erection.
