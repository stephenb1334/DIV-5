[Therapist's Address]

**Subject:** Formal Request for Medical Documentation and Scheduling Confirmation

Dear [Therapist's Name],

I am submitting this formal request for documentation concerning my PTSD diagnosis and treatment under your care. This request is being made for purposes of pending legal proceedings, including Florida landlord-tenant litigation, divorce proceedings, and my Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) application.

## I. Confirmation of Upcoming Appointments

At the conclusion of our most recent therapy session (Monday, May 19, 2025), we scheduled three upcoming appointments. Please confirm the exact dates and times of these scheduled appointments for recordkeeping purposes.

## II. PTSD Diagnosis & Treatment Summary

I request a comprehensive clinical statement addressing the following:

- **Pre-trauma treatment history:** Confirmation of treatment commencing prior to March 26, 2024
- **PTSD diagnosis:** Clinical diagnosis of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) causally linked to the violent home invasion at my residence, 2649 Tifton Street S, Gulfport, FL 33711
- **Ongoing symptomatology:** Current symptoms and treatment plans
- **Functional impairments:** Documented limitations observed during care affecting daily functioning
- **Medication management:** Details regarding prescribed medications including Sertraline, Guanfacine, Hydroxyzine, and Trileptal
- **Legal impact assessment:** Commentary on how trauma has affected my ability to function in personal, occupational, and legal matters

## III. Supporting Documentation from Bokhari Medical Consortium

This request is supported by parallel medical records provided by:

**Bokhari Medical Consortium, Inc.**  
716 Seminole Blvd  
Largo, FL 33770  
Tel: (727) 238-3241

Zainab Savard, NP, issued a formal PTSD diagnosis on June 12, 2024, which corroborates my clinical history and prescribed medications, establishing continuity of care across multiple providers.

## IV. Jurisdictional Residency Clarification

Though I am physically located in Maryland and receive correspondence at 21090 Sharp St, Unit 132, Rock Hall, MD 21661, my **legal domicile remains Florida** at 2649 Tifton Street S, Gulfport, FL 33711, for the following statutory reasons:

### Florida Domicile Established Prior to Marital Separation
- My primary and legal residence was established at the Florida property referenced above during my marriage
- All state filings, tax records, vehicle registrations, financial institutions, and healthcare providers remain connected to Florida jurisdiction

### Marital Vehicle Incident and DMV Administrative Freeze
Following my marital separation, my spouse, Melissa, physically removed our jointly held Jeep from Florida without my consent, transporting it across state lines. This unauthorized interstate relocation triggered multiple administrative holds within the Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles (DHSMV).

Specifically, the Florida DMV flagged my license and vehicle records under:
- **Florida Statutes § 320.02** (Interstate obligations tied to vehicle ownership and titling)
- **Florida Statutes § 322.01** (Residency-based obligations for maintaining valid Florida license)  
- **Florida Statutes § 322.251** (Unresolved financial responsibility tied to insurance/registration conflicts)

### Legal Inability to Establish Out-of-State Residency
Because the Florida DMV records remain unresolved and I cannot obtain the necessary clearance certificate required to secure a Maryland license, my legal domicile cannot transfer under:
- **Maryland Transportation Code § 16-115**
- **Maryland Transportation Code § 16-110**

Both statutes require surrender of prior state licensure as a prerequisite for issuance. Maryland law recognizes the controlling state of domicile as whichever state continues to maintain active license jurisdiction—Florida remains that state in my case.

### Legal Conclusion
I remain legally domiciled in Florida under both Florida and Maryland law for all residency, tax, DMV, and legal jurisdictional purposes. This DMV hold not only prevents jurisdictional transition but further anchors my administrative and legal ties to Florida.
