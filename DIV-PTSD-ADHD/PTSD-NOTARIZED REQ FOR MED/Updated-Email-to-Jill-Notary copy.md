Subject: Notarization & Legal Documentation: PTSD Records, Residency, and Jurisdictional Considerations

Dear Jill,

I wanted to provide you with a full and transparent picture of the situation, the legal context behind the documents I'm preparing, and why your role as notary is important within this process. This is not just a basic notarization — it directly supports multiple legal filings I'm assembling.

## The Legal Situation
I am preparing a formal request to my treating therapist to obtain clinical documentation of my ongoing PTSD treatment and diagnosis, which I intend to use for multiple legal and administrative matters including:

- Florida landlord-tenant litigation stemming from a violent home invasion that occurred at my residence on March 26, 2024;
- Divorce proceedings where emotional harm and trauma are active factors;
- Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) application where mental health limitations are core to my claim.

The letter I will be signing and asking you to notarize is intended to serve as an admissible legal exhibit, properly prepared for:
- Court discovery
- Subpoena response
- Custodian of records documentation
- SSDI administrative submission

I've carefully structured it for both evidentiary integrity and multi-jurisdictional compliance.

**Legal Residence (DMV/Jurisdiction):** 2649 Tifton Street S, Gulfport, FL 33711

## My Residency & Jurisdiction Status (Why Florida Law Applies)
While I am physically present in Maryland and receive mail at the Rock Hall address, my legal domicile is still fully anchored in Florida for multiple legal reasons, which directly impact the jurisdiction you're notarizing under:

### 1. Florida Residence Established Before Marital Separation
- My primary legal residence remains 2649 Tifton Street S, Gulfport, FL 33711 where I lived continuously prior to, during, and after the trauma event.
- All financial, medical, legal, and tax records are rooted in Florida jurisdiction.

### 2. Marital Vehicle Incident (Jeep Removed Across State Lines)
- After my marital separation, my spouse Melissa removed our jointly held Jeep from Florida without my consent, taking it out of state.
- The vehicle remained registered in Florida, triggering DMV-level problems that remain unresolved.

### 3. Florida DMV License Freeze
- The Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles (DHSMV) initiated an administrative freeze against my license, preventing me from clearing my record.
- Under Florida Statutes § 320.02, § 322.01, and § 322.251, my license remains legally locked in Florida's system.

### 4. Maryland License Blocked by Florida Hold
- Because Florida retains control over my license and driving record, Maryland cannot issue me a license under its Transportation Code §§ 16-110 and 16-115.
- I cannot transfer or sever Florida jurisdiction while this DMV freeze remains in place.

### 5. Legal Conclusion
- My legal domicile remains Florida under both Florida and Maryland law.
- This fact ties me, my legal obligations, and my medical care to Florida jurisdiction — which is why I need you as a Florida-commissioned notary to notarize this PTSD records request.

## Strategic Purpose of This Notarization
- The notarization will authenticate my formal request to my therapist.
- This document will likely be introduced as a certified exhibit in Florida civil court, SSDI filings, and potentially divorce-related proceedings.
- Having a Florida-based notarization eliminates jurisdictional objections and strengthens the evidentiary foundation.
- The document will reference my Bokhari Medical Consortium records (from Florida) that independently confirm my PTSD diagnosis and treatment plan.

## The Actual Document You'll Be Notarizing
The letter includes:
- A formal request for my therapist to provide PTSD documentation
- Reference to my treatment history and trauma timeline
- Disclosure of my pending legal proceedings
- Both my legal residence (Florida) and current mailing address (Maryland) for clarity
- A properly formatted Florida notarial acknowledgment block (Pinellas County venue, commission, identification clause)

## Next Steps
Once I meet with you, I will:
- Bring the final document printed and ready.
- Present valid identification as required.
- Sign in your presence for notarization under Florida law.
- Retain certified copies for legal submission.

Jill — I appreciate your precision and care with this notarization. This is a crucial procedural step as I prepare these filings. The document clearly distinguishes between my legal residence (Florida) and current mailing address (Maryland) to avoid any confusion while maintaining proper jurisdiction.

Please let me know if you have any questions or need anything further from me prior to our appointment.

Sincerely,
