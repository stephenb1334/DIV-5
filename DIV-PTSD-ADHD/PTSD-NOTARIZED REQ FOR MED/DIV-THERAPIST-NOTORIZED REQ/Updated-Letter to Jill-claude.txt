# Final Email to Jill - Notary Professional

**Subject:** Notarization & Legal Documentation: PTSD Records, Residency, and Multi-Jurisdictional Legal Strategy

Dear Jill,

I want to provide you with complete transparency about the legal significance of the document I need notarized and why your role as a Florida-commissioned notary is strategically important for my ongoing legal proceedings.

## Legal Context & Strategic Importance

I am preparing a formal request to my treating therapist (Mark Sieg, LMHC) to obtain comprehensive clinical documentation of my PTSD diagnosis and treatment. This documentation will serve as crucial evidence in multiple concurrent legal proceedings:

**Active Legal Matters:**
- **Delaware County, PA Divorce Proceedings** (Boerner v. Boerner) - where trauma and medical evidence impact property division and support determinations
- **Florida Landlord-Tenant Civil Litigation** - stemming from the March 26, 2024 violent home invasion at my Florida residence
- **Federal Social Security Disability Application** - where PTSD functional limitations are central to disability determination

**Document Purpose:**
This notarized letter will serve as an authenticated legal exhibit for:
- Court discovery and evidentiary submissions
- Subpoena compliance and custodian of records documentation
- SSDI administrative proceedings
- Expert witness foundation and deposition preparation

## Jurisdictional Foundation - Why Florida Notarization Is Required

Despite my physical presence in Maryland, my **legal domicile remains Florida** for compelling statutory reasons that directly impact the notarization jurisdiction:

### 1. Established Florida Legal Residence
- Primary residence established at 2649 Tifton Street S, Gulfport, FL 33711 throughout marriage
- All financial, medical, legal, and tax records anchored in Florida jurisdiction
- Healthcare providers, medical treatments, and legal proceedings originate in Florida

### 2. DMV Administrative Lock-In
Following marital separation, my spouse removed our jointly registered vehicle from Florida without consent, triggering:

**Florida DMV Administrative Freeze:**
- **Florida Statutes § 320.02** - Interstate vehicle ownership obligations
- **Florida Statutes § 322.01** - Residency-based license maintenance requirements  
- **Florida Statutes § 322.251** - Unresolved financial responsibility issues

**Maryland License Blockage:**
- **Maryland Transportation Code §§ 16-110 & 16-115** require surrender of prior state license
- Florida's administrative hold prevents the required clearance certificate
- Maryland cannot issue license while Florida maintains jurisdiction

### 3. Legal Conclusion
Both Florida and Maryland law recognize Florida as my controlling domicile jurisdiction. This DMV situation legally anchors all my residency, medical, and legal matters to Florida.

## Strategic Value of Florida Notarization

**Evidentiary Advantages:**
- Eliminates jurisdictional challenges to document admissibility
- Maintains consistency with Florida medical records and civil litigation
- Strengthens foundation for multi-state legal coordination

- **Bokhari Medical Consortium** (Largo, FL) - formal F43.10 PTSD diagnosis
- **QbTest neuropsychological assessment** - 99th percentile objective impairment scores
