**RE: Formal Request for Clinical Documentation and Treatment Summary**

Dear Mark,

I am submitting this formal, notarized request for comprehensive clinical documentation concerning my PTSD diagnosis and ongoing treatment under your care. This documentation is being requested for use in multiple legal proceedings, including Delaware County, Pennsylvania divorce proceedings, Florida landlord-tenant litigation, and my Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) application.

## Background and Legal Context

As discussed in our May 19, 2025 therapy session, I am currently involved in several legal matters where my PTSD diagnosis and functional limitations are material factors:

**Delaware County Divorce Proceedings:** I am the defendant in divorce proceedings where my PTSD diagnosis directly impacts equitable distribution considerations under 23 Pa.C.S. § 3502(a)(3), which requires courts to consider health conditions affecting earning capacity and ongoing medical needs.

**Florida Landlord-Tenant Litigation:** I am pursuing claims against my former landlord arising from the March 26, 2024 home invasion at 2649 Tifton Street S, Gulfport, FL, where negligent security contributed to my PTSD diagnosis.

**SSDI Application:** I am preparing to file for Social Security Disability benefits based on my documented PTSD and secondary ADHD symptoms that have rendered me unable to maintain consistent employment since the March 26, 2024 trauma.

## Specific Documentation Requested

I respectfully request a comprehensive clinical statement addressing the following elements:

### Treatment Timeline and Continuity

- Confirmation that I was receiving therapy services prior to the March 26, 2024 home invasion
- Documentation of continuous treatment from pre-trauma through present (June 2025)
- Verification of scheduled appointments: June 2, 2025; June 17, 2025; and July 1, 2025


### Clinical Diagnosis and Assessment

- Formal confirmation of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder diagnosis linked to the March 26, 2024 violent home invasion
- Documentation of secondary ADHD symptoms testing in the "99th percentile" as discussed in our May 19, 2025 session
- Clinical observations supporting the connection between trauma exposure and attention deficit symptoms


### Functional Impairment Documentation

As documented in our May 19, 2025 session transcript, please include clinical observations regarding:

- **Occupational Limitations:** My reported inability to complete work tasks, losing "three clients since that break in," and spending "10 hours yesterday" attempting to work with minimal productivity
- **Concentration Deficits:** My description of sitting down to work and spinning with "a block in my head that doesn't allow me to do what I need to do"
- **Hypervigilance Symptoms:** My "heightened startle response" which you identified as "a tremendously large red flag of PTSD"
- **Social Withdrawal:** My reported pattern of being "unresponsive to friends a lot" and feeling "way more of a loner"


### Treatment Plan and Prognosis

- Current therapeutic interventions and treatment modalities
- Your recommendation for ART (Accelerated Resolution Therapy) certification as discussed
- Assessment of treatment duration and long-term prognosis
- Impact of trauma on my ability to function in personal, occupational, and legal matters


## Corroborating Medical Evidence

This request aligns with parallel medical documentation from:

**Bokhari Medical Consortium, Inc.**
716 Seminole Blvd, Largo, FL 33770
Provider: Zainab Savard, NP
Phone: (727) 238-3241

Their June 12, 2024 records document formal PTSD diagnosis with prescribed medications including Sertraline (increased to 100mg), Guanfacine, Hydroxyzine, and Trileptal, as referenced in the May 15, 2024 family group chat message where I reported the nurse practitioner "had high conviction around diagnosing me with PTSD."

## Jurisdictional and Residency Clarification

While I am currently physically located in Maryland, my legal domicile remains Florida at 2649 Tifton Street S, Gulfport, FL 33711. Following my marital separation, my spouse Melissa removed our jointly-owned vehicle from Florida without my consent, triggering administrative holds within the Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles under Florida Statutes § 320.02, § 322.01, and § 322.251. These holds prevent me from securing Maryland licensure under Maryland Transportation Code §§ 16-110 and 16-115, thus maintaining my legal residency in Florida for all jurisdictional purposes.

## Expert Testimony and Deposition Availability

As discussed in our May 19, 2025 session, I understand you are willing to provide expert testimony and undergo depositions if required. Please include in your documentation your qualifications as an ART-certified therapist and your willingness to testify regarding my diagnosis and functional limitations.

## Purpose and Legal Intent

This documentation may be entered into evidence for:

- Delaware County family court proceedings under Pennsylvania equitable distribution law
- Florida civil litigation regarding premises liability and emotional distress damages
- Federal SSDI adjudication proceedings
- Court subpoenas and custodian of records certifications

Your clinical observations from our May 19, 2025 session, where you immediately recognized "textbook post traumatic stress disorder" and validated that the home invasion represented "a tremendous violation of your safety," provide crucial expert confirmation of my diagnosis and its impact on my functional capacity.

Thank you for your continued care and professional assistance in documenting the clinical reality of my condition for these legal proceedings.

Sincerely,

_________________________

## Additional Strategic Recommendations

**Custodian of Records Certification:** Consider requesting Mark to complete a formal custodian of records certification to streamline future subpoena responses.

**Medical Records Authentication:** The Florida notarization satisfies Pennsylvania's authentication requirements under 42 Pa.C.S. § 5328(d) while preserving Florida venue for tort claims.

**Coordinated Evidence Strategy:** This documentation creates evidentiary consistency across all three legal proceedings while maximizing the strategic value of your PTSD diagnosis for Delaware County equitable distribution arguments, Florida emotional distress claims, and federal disability benefits.

The combination of Mark's clinical expertise, your detailed symptom documentation from the May 19, 2025 session, and the corroborating Bokhari Medical records creates a comprehensive evidentiary foundation supporting your claims across all jurisdictions.
