## RE: FORMAL REQUEST FOR COMPREHENSIVE MEDICAL DOCUMENTATION, THERAPY RECORDS, AND PROFESSIONAL PARTICIPATION IN LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

Dear Mark Sig,

I, Stephen J. Boerner, hereby submit this formal, notarized request for comprehensive clinical documentation concerning my Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) diagnosis and ongoing therapeutic treatment under your professional care. This documentation is being formally requested pursuant to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and Florida Statutes § 456.057 for use in multiple legal proceedings requiring authenticated medical evidence.

## LEGAL CONTEXT AND JURISDICTIONAL REQUIREMENTS

This request supports documentation needs for the following concurrent legal matters:

**Delaware County, Pennsylvania Divorce Proceedings:**  
Case pending in Delaware County Court of Common Pleas, where I am the defendant. My PTSD diagnosis directly impacts equitable distribution considerations under 23 Pa.C.S. § 3502(a)(3), which mandates courts consider "the age, health, station, amount and sources of income, vocational skills, employability, estate, liabilities and needs of each of the parties."

**Florida Landlord-Tenant Litigation:**  
Premises liability claims against my former landlord arising from the March 26, 2024 violent home invasion at 2649 Tifton Street S, Gulfport, FL 33711, where negligent security contributed to my PTSD diagnosis and ongoing functional limitations.

**Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) Application:**  
Federal disability benefits application based on documented PTSD and secondary ADHD symptoms that have rendered me unable to maintain consistent employment since the March 26, 2024 traumatic event.

## SPECIFIC MEDICAL DOCUMENTATION REQUESTED

### A. Comprehensive Treatment Summary and Clinical Assessment

Please provide a detailed clinical statement addressing the following elements:

**1. Treatment Timeline and Continuity of Care**
- Confirmation of therapeutic services provided prior to the March 26, 2024 home invasion

- Verification of all scheduled appointments, including upcoming sessions: June 2, 2025; June 17, 2025; and July 1, 2025
- Complete session attendance records and therapeutic engagement patterns

**2. Formal Diagnosis and Clinical Findings**
- Official confirmation of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder diagnosis specifically linked to the March 26, 2024 violent home invasion at 2649 Tifton Street S, Gulfport, FL
- Documentation of secondary ADHD symptoms manifesting post-trauma, including my reported testing results in the "99th percentile" as discussed in our May 19, 2025 therapy session
- Clinical observations supporting the established medical connection between trauma exposure and subsequent attention deficit symptomatology
- Differential diagnosis considerations and ruling out of pre-existing conditions

### B. Functional Impairment and Disability Assessment

Based on documented clinical observations from our therapeutic sessions, particularly our May 19, 2025 session transcript, please provide detailed professional assessment of:

**Occupational and Vocational Limitations:**
- My reported inability to complete work-related tasks and maintain productivity
- Loss of "three clients since that break in" as documented in session notes
- Specific attention and concentration deficits affecting work performance
- Time management and task completion difficulties, including reported instances of spending "10 hours yesterday" attempting work with minimal output

- Assessment of executive functioning impairments

- Impact on decision-making and problem-solving abilities

- Professional qualifications and credentials supporting expert witness capacity
- Your credentials as an ART-certified therapist and clinical experience with trauma patients

## SUPPORTING EVIDENCE AND FAMILY WITNESS TESTIMONY

### Family Group Chat Documentation

This request is supported by contemporaneous family communications documenting my medical journey. In a family group text message dated May 15, 2024, sent to Carol Boerner (mother), Jeffrey Boerner (father), and Melissa Bemer (wife), I provided real-time documentation of my medical appointment and formal PTSD diagnosis:

> "Really really good appointment with nurse practitioner of neurology. Full diagnosis is pending as she will know more as she gets to know me over time, but I'm sticking with this woman, she was excellent. Melissa joined me today. Glad we didnt wait for the other appointment later this month. More time and basic tests yet to go, but for now she had high conviction around diagnosing me with PTSD. She is doubling my Zoloft to 100 mg, adding a mood stabilizer, and added a BP med that is also used to treat attention deficit. Throw in a pinch of depression, make it two pinches actually, and a sprinkling of anxiety as well - all of which should be dealt with by taking these meds, physical regime, starting a cognitive therapy regime through this new clinic, and things like mindful meditation etc. - all in all, some new info, some info we knew already, a few hunches confirmed, and we're off and running. Love and thanks to you all. I got this. We got this. I'm much better overall. No sugar on this coat, but a long way to go."

This family communication serves as independent corroboration of:
- The formal PTSD diagnosis by a nurse practitioner of neurology
- Melissa's participation as a witness to the medical appointment
- The comprehensive treatment plan including medication adjustments
- The temporal relationship between trauma and formal diagnosis
- Family support network awareness of my condition

### Corroborating Medical Evidence

This therapeutic documentation aligns with parallel medical records from:

**Bokhari Medical Consortium, Inc.**  
716 Seminole Blvd, Largo, FL 33770  
Provider: Zainab Savard, NP  
Phone: (727) 238-3241  

Their records document formal PTSD diagnosis with prescribed medications including Sertraline (increased to 100mg), Guanfacine, Hydroxyzine, and Trileptal, providing independent medical confirmation of the diagnosis referenced in the family group chat communications.

## LEGAL DOMICILE AND JURISDICTIONAL CONSIDERATIONS

### Florida Residency Maintenance

While I am currently physically located in Maryland due to marital separation circumstances, my legal domicile remains Florida at 2649 Tifton Street S, Gulfport, FL 33711. Following marital separation, my spouse Melissa removed our jointly-owned 2017 Jeep Cherokee from Florida without my consent, triggering administrative holds within the Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles under Florida Statutes § 320.02, § 322.01, and § 322.251.

These administrative holds prevent me from securing Maryland driver's license under Maryland Transportation Code §§ 16-110 and 16-115, thus maintaining my legal residency in Florida for all jurisdictional purposes. This Florida domicile preservation ensures:

- Admissibility of Florida-notarized medical records in Pennsylvania family court proceedings
- Venue consistency for Florida landlord-tenant litigation
- Unified evidentiary approach across multiple legal proceedings
- Compliance with cross-jurisdictional authentication requirements

## HIPAA AUTHORIZATION AND PRIVACY CONSIDERATIONS

### Voluntary Medical Records Disclosure

This formal request constitutes voluntary disclosure of protected health information under HIPAA Privacy Rule provisions. I hereby authorize and request the release of all medical records, therapy notes, treatment plans, diagnostic assessments, and clinical observations related to my PTSD diagnosis and ongoing treatment.

This authorization specifically includes:
- Complete session notes and therapeutic observations
- Diagnostic assessments and psychological testing results
- Treatment plans and progress evaluations
- Medication recommendations and coordination communications
- Clinical correspondence and consultation notes

### Privacy Protection Strategy

Pennsylvania's Mental Health Procedures Act provides strong confidentiality protections preventing opposing parties from compelling disclosure of mental health records. By voluntarily providing authenticated documentation through this notarized request, I maintain control over:
- Timing and content of medical evidence presentation
- Strategic narrative development across multiple legal proceedings
- Privacy protections for sensitive treatment details not material to legal claims

## EXPERT TESTIMONY AND DEPOSITION AVAILABILITY

### Professional Qualifications and Credentials

Please include in your documentation a summary of your professional qualifications supporting expert witness testimony, including:
- Educational background and clinical training
- Licensing and certification credentials
- ART (Accelerated Resolution Therapy) certification and specialized trauma training
- Experience treating PTSD patients and providing expert testimony in legal proceedings

### Availability for Legal Proceedings

As discussed in our May 19, 2025 therapy session, please confirm your availability to:
- Provide expert testimony regarding my PTSD diagnosis and functional limitations
- Participate in depositions and discovery proceedings
- Appear for court testimony if required by subpoena or voluntary agreement
- Provide additional clinical clarification as needed during legal proceedings

## PURPOSE AND INTENDED USE OF DOCUMENTATION

This comprehensive medical documentation will be entered into evidence for:

**Pennsylvania Family Court Proceedings:**
- Equitable distribution arguments under 23 Pa.C.S. § 3502(a)(3) health factors
- Spousal support considerations based on reduced earning capacity
- Property division calculations accounting for ongoing medical needs

**Florida Civil Litigation:**
- Premises liability claims for emotional distress damages
- Negligent security breach resulting in psychological injury
- Medical expense documentation and future care cost projections

**Federal SSDI Adjudication:**

- Medical evidence supporting inability to engage in substantial gainful activity
- Professional assessment of work capacity and vocational limitations

## CLINICAL OBSERVATIONS FROM MAY 19, 2025 SESSION

Your clinical assessment during our May 19, 2025 therapy session provided crucial professional confirmation of my condition. Your immediate recognition of "textbook post traumatic stress disorder" and identification of my "heightened startle response" as "a tremendously large red flag of PTSD" establishes expert clinical validation.

Your professional statement that the March 26, 2024 home invasion represented "a tremendous violation of your safety" provides authoritative clinical confirmation of the trauma's severity and its ongoing psychological impact on my functional capacity.

## REQUEST FOR EXPEDITED PROCESSING

Given the time-sensitive nature of these legal proceedings, I respectfully request expedited processing of this documentation request. Under HIPAA provisions, healthcare providers have 30 days to respond to medical records requests, with one additional 30-day extension available for good cause.

Please notify me immediately if any additional information or clarification is needed to process this request promptly.

## CERTIFICATION AND LEGAL ACKNOWLEDGMENT

I hereby certify under penalty of perjury that the information contained in this request is true and accurate to the best of my knowledge. This notarized document serves as formal legal notice of my medical records request and authorization for disclosure of protected health information for the specified legal proceedings.

I acknowledge that this documentation may be subject to:
- Court subpoenas and discovery proceedings
- Expert witness testimony and cross-examination
- Custodian of records certifications and authentication requirements
- Federal and state evidentiary rules and admissibility standards

Thank you for your continued professional care and assistance in documenting the clinical reality of my PTSD condition and its profound impact on my functional capacity across all areas of life.

I look forward to your prompt response and comprehensive documentation supporting these critical legal proceedings.

Respectfully submitted,
