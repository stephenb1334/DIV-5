  {
    "text" : "of the Platinum program, and I end up taking, like,"

  {
    "text" : "my, you know, top-tier students, or, you know,"
  },
  {
    "text" : "somebody who just needs help, okay, is, you know,"

  {
    "text" : "here's what I'm saying on here, okay,"
  },
  {
    "text" : "so I buy a lot of properties from various different sources,"

  {
    "text" : "okay, you know, one of them, you know,"

  {
    "text" : "and here's, here's what happens, okay,"
  },
  {
    "text" : "so let me give the gist of it, all right,"
  },
  {
    "text" : "so, you know, you buy a piece of real estate,"
  },
  {
    "text" : "and what do you have to do, okay,"
  },
  {
    "text" : "not only do you have to pay a mortgage,"
  },
  {
    "text" : "you have to pay real estate taxes, right,"
  },
  {
    "text" : "so what happens is that those who don't pay real estate taxes"
  },
  {
    "text" : "it goes into a, you know, a tax sale, okay,"
  },
  {
    "text" : "so foreclosure, for, you know,"
  },
  {
    "text" : "I'm gonna just kind of give you a flavor of, you know,"
  },
  {
    "text" : "this on yours, but, you know,"
  },
  {
    "text" : "foreclosure and tax sale is a little bit different"
  },
  {
    "text" : "in terms of when the property goes through foreclosure,"
  },
  {
    "text" : "the deed, the title, you know, okay,"
  },
  {
    "text" : "or the title is still a marketable title,"
  },
  {
    "text" : "it's not that, it's not that, you know,"
  },
  {
    "text" : "that bit of an issue,"
  },
  {
    "text" : "when a property goes through a tax sale"
  },
  {
    "text" : "and it's taken back from the county,"
  },
  {
    "text" : "that title, okay, title is, you know,"
  },
  {
    "text" : "when they pull a, you know, a title on a property,"
  },
  {
    "text" : "and they do that every time you make a transaction, okay,"
  },
  {
    "text" : "they look to see if every time that, you know,"
  },
  {
    "text" : "from the time that somebody built it,"
  },
  {
    "text" : "and it goes to the next buyer, you know,"
  },
  {
    "text" : "they make sure all that stuff is clean,"
  },
  {
    "text" : "and there's no, you know, there's no, you know,"
  },
  {
    "text" : "defect in that title there,"
  },
  {
    "text" : "meaning like there's no mechanics lien,"
  },
  {
    "text" : "all that kind of stuff,"
  },
  {
    "text" : "and what a buyer will do is they'll buy an insurance,"
  },
  {
    "text" : "and you do this from a title company, okay,"
  },
  {
    "text" : "you did this, everybody does this, okay,"
  },
  {
    "text" : "you buy a title insurance, you know,"
  },
  {
    "text" : "title insurance saying that this title insurance,"
  },
  {
    "text" : "which is the closing law,"
  },
  {
    "text" : "basically will give you insurance saying that"
  },
  {
    "text" : "they guarantee that there's no defects in the title,"
  },
  {
    "text" : "and so if they missed a, let's say, you know,"
  },
  {
    "text" : "a mechanics lien, you're not liable for it,"
  },
  {
    "text" : "the insurance will pay for that,"
  },
  {
    "text" : "okay, that's called title insurance."
  },
  {
    "text" : "You can't get that with tax sale properties there, okay,"
  },
  {
    "text" : "it's a dirty deed, I always call it dirty deed, okay,"
  },
  {
    "text" : "so what does that mean?"
  },
  {
    "text" : "Well, you know, I said this to you,"
  },
  {
    "text" : "Dave Wanda, when we're doing this on the series,"

  {
    "text" : "and I just say, you know, as an investor,"

  {
    "text" : "you look for problem properties, okay,"

    "text" : "and when you become the solver,"

  },
  {
    "text" : "the more opportunity that you have to make money on here,"
  },
  {
    "text" : "okay, so I buy a lot of these tax sale properties,"
  },
  {
    "text" : "and the bad thing about these tax sale properties,"
  },
  {
    "text" : "okay, and it's, you know, there's auctions,"

  {
    "text" : "and people think that's, you know, what I'm talking about,"
  },
  {
    "text" : "I don't do that, that's just, that's common shit, okay,"

    "text" : "that's like finding stuff on MLS, okay,"

  {
    "text" : "where, you know, you go to auction,"

    "text" : "parcel number da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da, you know,"

    "text" : "and, you know, you know, upsell price of, you know,"

  {
    "text" : "$10,000, and the prices are cheap,"

    "text" : "because all they're doing is reselling that"

    "text" : "for the amount of what's, you know,"

    "text" : "owed on the property tax on there, okay,"
  },
  {
    "text" : "yeah, you can find some good deals on there,"
  },
  {
    "text" : "but, you know, usually, you know,"
  },
  {
    "text" : "they get overbidded to the point where you're,"

    "text" : "a decent amount of money for that, okay,"

    "text" : "that's not what the action is, okay,"
  },
  {
    "text" : "I have, it's certainly a way of finding these things on here,"
  },
  {
    "text" : "and, you know, and getting these things on here,"
  },
  {
    "text" : "what's the pain in the ass part about this?"
  },
  {
    "text" : "Well, it's a long game, okay,"
  },
  {
    "text" : "it takes, like, nine months to 12 months"

  {
    "text" : "to realize the profit,"
  },
  {
    "text" : "what's the benefit to it?"

  {
    "text" : "Well, you go in there fucking cheap, okay,"
  },
  {
    "text" : "you're not going in there,"
  },
  {
    "text" : "I mean, unless you're buying at the auction,"
  },
  {
    "text" : "then everybody's gonna bid you up,"
  },
  {
    "text" : "and then, you know, you have to pay a premium to that,"
  },
  {
    "text" : "but, you know, the problem with these things on here"
  },
  {
    "text" : "is that you have to rehab to deal on that, okay,"
  },
  {
    "text" : "and I have a bunch of guys out in California"
  },
  {
    "text" : "who are, you know, they specialize in doing this,"

  {
    "text" : "and, you know, if you go through a regular title,"

  {
    "text" : "if you go through a regular attorney,"

  {
    "text" : "they're gonna charge you, like, $70,000"

    "text" : "to do what's called quiet titling,"

    "text" : "I have a bunch of guys that does just that,"
  },
  {
    "text" : "and they don't charge that much in the expedite,"
  },
  {
    "text" : "but it's a process you have to go through, okay,"
  },
  {
    "text" : "so what happens is that you realize the profit,"
  },
  {
    "text" : "like, you know, like, I just, you know,"
  },
  {
    "text" : "across the board, it's gonna take 12 months, okay,"
  },
  {
    "text" : "but making, like, a two, three thousand,"
  },
  {
    "text" : "and it's gonna be about 3,000 bucks, okay,"
  },
  {
    "text" : "you end up walking away with making, like,"
  },
  {
    "text" : "30, 40 thousand dollars, okay,"
  },
  {
    "text" : "that's the benefit to that,"
  },
  {
    "text" : "so for someone like me, okay,"
  },
  {
    "text" : "you know, I bid these things all the time, okay,"
  },
  {
    "text" : "and, you know, the benefit is that I'm willing to pay,"
  },
  {
    "text" : "you know, I'm willing to pay the long game,"
  },
  {
    "text" : "which is waiting for a year, okay,"

  {
    "text" : "and then what happens is that, you know,"
  },
  {
    "text" : "a year from now, you end up walking away"
  },
  {
    "text" : "with, like, you know, 30, 40 thousand dollars, okay,"
