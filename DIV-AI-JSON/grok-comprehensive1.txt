Comprehensive Report: Boerner v. Bemer Divorce Proceedings

Key Points





Stephen Boerner’s Financial Contributions: Stephen has contributed $40,200 to maintain the marital property, significantly more than Melissa Bemer’s $7,000, suggesting he deserves credits in the property division.



Disability and Financial Hardship: Stephen’s PTSD and ADHD, diagnosed after a 2024 home invasion, prevent him from working, supporting his need for alimony and relief from equal expense sharing.



Melissa’s Non-Disclosure: Melissa’s failure to report her new job and financial transactions may lead to court sanctions, strengthening Stephen’s case for equitable adjustments.



Property Sale Challenges: The condo’s $399,000 listing price aligns with market trends, but foreclosure looms if payments stop, requiring urgent court action.



Legal Support: Pennsylvania laws and Delaware County practices favor Stephen due to his disability and Melissa’s alleged misconduct, though outcomes depend on court rulings.

Overview

In the divorce proceedings between Stephen J. Boerner and Melissa A. Bemer in Delaware County, Pennsylvania, the central issue is the equitable distribution of their marital property, a condominium at 246 N. 3rd Street, Unit 4CD, Philadelphia, PA. Stephen, the defendant, seeks credits for his substantial financial contributions and relief due to his disability, while Melissa, the plaintiff, disputes the property’s listing price and proposes equal expense sharing despite her minimal contributions and alleged financial non-disclosure. This report provides a detailed, human-readable analysis of the case, expanding on every aspect with supporting evidence and research to ensure clarity and persuasiveness.

Why This Matters

The case involves significant financial and emotional stakes. Stephen’s inability to work due to PTSD, coupled with Melissa’s alleged withholding of financial information, creates a complex situation where Pennsylvania law must balance fairness. The property’s potential foreclosure adds urgency, as both parties risk losing equity if unresolved. Understanding the full scope of contributions, health impacts, and legal arguments is crucial for a fair outcome.

What’s at Stake





Financial Equity: Stephen’s $40,200 in contributions versus Melissa’s $7,000 could influence how the court divides the property’s proceeds.



Support Needs: Stephen’s disability may entitle him to alimony to cover living and medical expenses.



Property Preservation: The condo’s sale or foreclosure will determine whether the parties retain equity or face debt.



Legal Precedents: Melissa’s non-disclosure could lead to sanctions, setting a precedent for transparency in divorce cases.



Detailed Analysis and Legal Strategy

Case Overview

The divorce case, Boerner v. Bemer, filed by Melissa on July 31, 2024, in Delaware County, Pennsylvania, centers on the equitable distribution of a jointly owned condominium purchased on April 15, 2022, for $400,000. Key issues include:





Equitable Distribution: Dividing the property’s value, considering Stephen’s $40,200 in contributions versus Melissa’s $7,000.



Financial Hardship: Stephen’s disability and lack of income contrast with Melissa’s stable employment.



Foreclosure Risk: The property faces default on April 17, 2025, if mortgage payments cease.



Non-Disclosure: Melissa’s failure to report her employment and financial transactions raises concerns of bad faith.



Alimony Needs: Stephen’s PTSD and ADHD justify temporary and potentially long-term support.

The case is governed by Pennsylvania’s Divorce Code, particularly 23 Pa.C.S. § 3502 for equitable distribution and § 3701 for alimony, with Delaware County courts known for protecting disabled spouses and enforcing transparency.
