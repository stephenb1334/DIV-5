    "Stephen Boerner contributed approximately $40,200 to preserve the marital property, including $8,400 for rental deficits, $19,800 for full carrying costs, and $12,000 for HVAC replacement, compared to Melissa Bemer’s $7,000 in sporadic payments.",
    "Stephen’s disability (PTSD and ADHD) and lack of income contrast with Melissa’s full-time employment, supporting an adjusted expense allocation.",
    "The $399,000 listing price aligns with Old City market trends, with a median condo price of $329,995 and recent sales indicating a softening market, justifying the price reduction to avoid foreclosure.",
    "Pennsylvania statutes (23 Pa.C.S. § 3502) and case law (Biese v. Biese, Duff v. Duff, Robert v. Martin) support credits for Stephen’s preservation efforts and consideration of his economic hardship.",
    "Melissa’s minimal contributions and recent financial actions (e.g., $3,790.35 account withdrawal, employment non-disclosure) suggest a pattern of financial abandonment, strengthening Stephen’s claim for equitable relief."

    "mortgage_payments": "Melissa deposited half the mortgage payment and expects Stephen to match, despite his financial incapacity and her prior non-contribution.",

  "rebuttals": {
    "listing_price": "The price is supported by market data showing a 15% price decline in Old City, with comparable sales and a median list price of $329,995. Melissa’s claim lacks evidence and contradicts her agreement.",
    "hoa_fees": "Stephen’s $40,200 contribution dwarfs Melissa’s $7,000; equal splitting is inequitable given his disability and her employment.",
    "mortgage_payments": "Stephen’s $19,800 in prior payments and exhausted $12,500 bridge loan contrast with Melissa’s recent contribution; his financial constraints necessitate court intervention.",
