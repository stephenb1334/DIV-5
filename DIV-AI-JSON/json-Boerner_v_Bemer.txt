### Summary of Key Details
- **Case Overview**: Divorce proceedings in Delaware County, PA, involving the equitable distribution of a marital condo at 246 N. 3rd Street, Unit 4CD. Stephen Boerner (defendant) seeks credits for his substantial contributions, while Melissa Bemer (plaintiff) disputes the listing price and proposes equal expense splitting.
- **Financial Disparity**: Stephen contributed $40,200 (85.2%) to property maintenance, including $8,400 in rental deficits, $19,800 in full costs, and $12,000 for HVAC replacement, versus Melissa’s $7,000 (14.8%).
- **Listing Price**: The $399,000 price is justified by a 15% Old City price decline, median list price of $329,995, and comparable sales ($352,500–$620,000), aimed at avoiding foreclosure.
- **Health and Economic Context**: Stephen’s disability (PTSD, ADHD) and no income contrast with Melissa’s full-time nursing job, supporting adjusted expense allocation.
- **Legal Framework**: 23 Pa.C.S. § 3502 and cases like *Biese v. Biese*, *Duff v. Duff*, and *Robert v. Martin* favor credits for Stephen’s preservation efforts.
- **Bridge Loan**: $12,500 loan taken by Stephen should be treated as marital debt or credited, given its use for property preservation.
- **Disclosure Issues**: Melissa’s undisclosed withdrawals ($3,790.35, $1,500, $4,500) and employment may warrant sanctions.
