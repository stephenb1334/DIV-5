Monthly carrying costs for this property, including mortgage, HOA fees, taxes, insurance, and utilities, are approximately $3,300. During this period, both parties contribute to shared finances. Mr. Boerner, a professional, serves as the primary financial provider. Notably, from 2020-2021, Mr. Boerner financially contributes to Ms. Bemer's education at Villanova, enhancing *her* future earning capacity."},

Separately, from January to April 2024, Mr. Boerner invests extensive time, intellectual property (including proprietary trade secrets for creative media), capital, and expertise (photography, videography, marketing) to establish a joint adult entertainment venture ('OnlyFans') with Ms. Bemer, intended for her to monetize through his created content and strategic guidance. Monetization potential from Mr. Boerner's 591 created media files (approx. 4 hours video/photos) is conservatively valued between $60,000 - $180,000 over two years. Mr. Boerner provides the foundational creative and technical engine."},

This traumatic event is a critical turning point. It leads directly to a documented medical diagnosis of severe Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and high-percentile ADHD, medically confirmed as rendering him unemployable.

Mr. Boerner presents this option. Ms. Bemer **emphatically rejects** FMLA, stating, '**She was emphatically against the idea and couldn't move outside of making money being the priority.**' Her termination of employment on July 28, 2024, directly severs Mr. Boerner's health insurance coverage on August 1, 2024, forcing him to secure expensive coverage ($277/month, MD Health Exchange) while disabled and without income, a cost he continues to bear in April 2025. This was not incidental; it was a direct choice prioritizing her perceived income-earning options over his healthcare during a medical crisis."},

This loan is explicitly documented and obtained *solely for the preservation of the marital property* by covering specific mortgage payments ($7,482.39) and maintenance ($2,441.65) from December 2024 through March 16, 2025."},

Her rejection of FMLA (availability confirmed to me), based on her chilling statement 'She was emphatically against the idea and couldn't move outside of making money being the priority,' which directly led to the termination of my health insurance during active trauma treatment, elevates this to willful medical abandonment. Pennsylvania law recognizes this malicious prioritizing of perceived personal financial gain over spousal healthcare during a crisis as conduct relevant to denying support and adjusting distribution (Larkin v. Larkin, In re: Marriage of Donnelly, Harrison v. Harrison, Commonwealth v. Brewer). My forced, ongoing health insurance cost ($277/month) is a direct, traceable damage."},

The prior year's deficit she failed to cover (approx. $1,400 remaining beyond her $7,000 contribution) further underscores her history of non-contribution when convenient.

Leveraging my specialized photography, videography, marketing, and technical skills, I created 591 media files (approx. 4 hours video, numerous photos) with explicit intent for commercial distribution, documented even within the content itself. My labor was extensive, my financial outlay included technology and materials, and the understanding was my technical/creative/marketing role while she was the subject. In April 2024, citing 'not the right time,' she unilaterally shut it down, abandoning the venture entirely, offering *zero* compensation for my labor, IP, and expenses, and disregarding a revenue stream conservatively valued between $60,000 - $180,000 from the assets *I created*. This abandonment constitutes dissipation of marital assets or, at minimum, unilateral destruction of value I created through my contribution (23 Pa.C.S. § 3502(a)(7)). This further underscores her pattern of prioritizing 'making money' when and how it suits *her*, without accountability for abandoned joint efforts."},
            {"type": "sub_section", "heading": "D. Deliberate Financial Concealment and Violations of Discovery", "details": "Your client's actions demonstrate clear intent to deceive regarding her financial status. The timing and non-disclosure of destination for the $3,790.35 withdrawal from the Santander account immediately before costs spiked creates a compelling inference of intentional financial sequestration. Most egregious is her failure to disclose full-time employment at the Hospital of Pennsylvania starting in December 2024 in required financial disclosures. This active concealment of income and capacity, while simultaneously contributing $0 and watching me approach financial ruin, is a blatant violation of Pa.R.C.P. 1920.33, warranting sanctions and adverse inferences regarding the extent of her financial recovery and resources."},

Furthermore, the requests conveyed by my former counsel (Feb 10, 2025) for proof regarding my prior gold sale, non-existent current business income (while she hides *her* income), outdated tax returns (proving *my* past support including *her* education), and an unrelated lawsuit, demonstrate either a fundamental misunderstanding of the relevant issues (driven by her bad faith) or a cynical attempt to deflect from her conduct by burying the case in irrelevant inquiries."}

The $12,500 loan I secured from my parents on January 3, 2025, was incurred during the marriage (pre-divorce finalization) with the explicit, sole, and documented purpose of preserving the marital property by funding specific mortgage payments ($7,482.39) and maintenance ($2,441.65) from December 2024 through March 16, 2025. **Under clear Pennsylvania law, debt incurred during the marriage to preserve marital property is marital debt, irrespective of sole signature or other spouse's knowledge/consent, as the estate benefits.** (Hicks v. Kubit, 758 A.2d 202, 205 (Pa. Super. 2000); 23 Pa.C.S. § 3501(b)). My authority to act unilaterally stemmed from the necessity to preserve the asset from impending foreclosure (23 Pa.C.S. § 3505) – an act of preservation, not an unauthorized disposition (Patwardhan v. Brabant, 439 A.2d 784). This $12,500 loan is undeniably a marital obligation, born directly of your client's failure to contribute, and she will be held accountable for her share.

The 'bills being due' you lament, and the imminent foreclosure risk (as of April 16, 2025), are the entirely predictable and calculated outcomes of your client's sustained, deliberate financial abandonment that drove me to ruin."}

This memorandum is signed 'Defendant Pro Se' for a deliberate, fact-driven reason rooted in your client's imposition of financial emergency upon me and the response to it by my former counsel. As detailed herein, your client's sustained financial abandonment led directly to the exhaustion of funds I borrowed (the Marital Preservation Bridge Loan) specifically to save the marital asset, triggering imminent foreclosure risk (as of April 16, 2025). During the period immediately preceding and following this critical juncture, including when your client's settlement proposals concerning the property were received, my counsel of record, Maria Testa, Esquire, became unresponsive to urgent communications requesting guidance on navigating this direct, severe, and time-sensitive financial emergency, which resulted from your client's *actions* and occurred *during* my disabling medical condition. This extended unresponsiveness (13+ days during the March 2025 crisis period) at a moment requiring immediate legal strategy regarding property preservation, debt, and response to opposing counsel about the jeopardized asset, demonstrates a fundamental inability to provide effective representation needed for this complex case involving severe financial distress caused by the opposing party and exacerbated by a disabling medical condition. Accordingly, let this Postscript serve as FORMAL NOTICE that the services of Maria Testa, Esquire, as counsel for Defendant, Stephen Boerner, in the case of Boerner v. Bemer, Case No. [Insert Case Number Here], are hereby TERMINATED EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY for cause based on failure to provide necessary and timely counsel during a documented financial emergency precipitated by your client's conduct and occurring amidst my severe medical disability. All future communications regarding this case, including any response to this memorandum or proposals regarding resolution based on the documented reality and non-negotiable terms presented herein, are to be directed SOLELY and EXCLUSIVELY to me, Stephen Boerner, directly as Defendant Pro Se. Be guided accordingly."}
