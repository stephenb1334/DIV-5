  "conclusion": "Melissa's unilateral discontinuation of contributions to the jointly owned condominium, combined with her non-disclosure of financial records post-2024-09-30, violates Pennsylvania family law principles of equitable distribution and transparency. Stephen's efforts to maintain the property despite his disability, including $29,400 in contributions and a $12,500 bridge loan, highlight the inequity of Melissa's actions. Her refusal to contribute, non-disclosure, and termination of Stephen's health benefits position Stephen favorably for interim relief, retroactive contributions, sanctions against Melissa, a larger share of the marital estate, and alimony. The condo's unsold status and impending foreclosure risk underscore the urgency of court intervention to resolve this financial dispute and protect Stephen's interests."
