A review of MLS data finds no similar sales in the subject building within the past year and no sales of reasonably similar condos with\n2-car parking. While this is a valuable contributor to value, the adjustment is reduced from the more typical $30,000/space to reflect the off-site\nnature of the subject's parking amenity. The comparables are included as the most recent sales of similar size 2-bedroom, 2-bath units.\nComparable 1 offers no parking and would typically not be considered. However, it is included due to similar overall condition. Comparables 2&3\noffer more upgrading (5% adjustment to Comparable 2 which offers superior kitchen, bath and flooring; 3% to Comparable 3 which offers modestly\nsuperior kitchen finishes and superior flooring). Comparables 2&3 are in superior condition (10%). The adjustments are based on historic market\ndata. See \"Additional Comments\" in the Supplemental Addendum & additional comparable. As adjusted, the comparables form a reliable range of\nindicated value for the subject. Most weight is given Comparable 1, which is most similar in terms of condition and quality, with an opinion of value\ntowards the upper end of the range considered appropriate.\n\n410,000\n\nThe income approach is generally not considered relevant in the case of single\nfamily housing in an owner occupied area.\n\n410,000\nSole consideration is placed on the sales comparison approach.

This report form is not designed to report an appraisal of a manufactured home or a unit in a\ncooperative project.\n\nThis appraisal report is subject to the following scope of work, intended use, intended user, definition of market value,\nstatement of assumptions and limiting conditions, and certifications. Modifications, additions, or deletions to the intended\nuse, intended user, definition of market value, or assumptions and limiting conditions are not permitted. The appraiser may\nexpand the scope of work to include any additional research or analysis necessary based on the complexity of this appraisal\nassignment. Modifications or deletions to the certifications are also not permitted. However, additional certifications that do\nnot constitute material alterations to this appraisal report, such as those required by law or those related to the appraiser's\ncontinuing education or membership in an appraisal organization, are permitted.\n\nThe scope of work for this appraisal is defined by the complexity of this appraisal assignment and the\nreporting requirements of this appraisal report form, including the following definition of market value, statement of\nassumptions and limiting conditions, and certifications. The appraiser must, at a minimum: (1) perform a complete visual\ninspection of the interior and exterior areas of the subject unit, (2) inspect and analyze the condominium project, (3) inspect\nthe neighborhood, (4) inspect each of the comparable sales from at least the street, (5) research, verify, and analyze data\nfrom reliable public and/or private sources, and (6) report his or her analysis, opinions, and conclusions in this appraisal\nreport.\n\nThe intended use of this appraisal report is for the lender/client to evaluate the property that is the\nsubject of this appraisal for a mortgage finance transaction.\n\nThe intended user of this appraisal report is the lender/client.\n\nThe most probable price which a property should bring in a competitive and open market under all\nconditions requisite to a fair sale, the buyer and seller, each acting prudently, knowledgeably and assuming the price is not\naffected by undue stimulus. Implicit in this definition is the consummation of a sale as of a specified date and the passing of\ntitle from seller to buyer under conditions whereby: (1) buyer and seller are typically motivated; (2) both parties are well\ninformed or well advised, and each acting in what he or she considers his or her own best interest; (3) a reasonable time is\nallowed for exposure in the open market; (4) payment is made in terms of cash in U. S. dollars or in terms of financial\narrangements comparable thereto; and (5) the price represents the normal consideration for the property sold unaffected by\nspecial or creative financing or sales concessions* granted by anyone associated with the sale.\n\n*Adjustments to the comparables must be made for special or creative financing or sales concessions. No adjustments are\nnecessary for those costs which are normally paid by sellers as a result of tradition or law in a market area; these costs are\nreadily identifiable since the seller pays these costs in virtually all sales transactions. Special or creative financing\nadjustments can be made to the comparable property by comparisons to financing terms offered by a third party institutional\nlender that is not already involved in the property or transaction. Any adjustment should not be calculated on a mechanical\ndollar for dollar cost of the financing or concession but the dollar amount of any adjustment should approximate the market's\nreaction to the financing or concessions based on the appraiser's judgment.\n\nThe appraiser's certification in this report is\nsubject to the following assumptions and limiting conditions:\n\n1. The appraiser will not be responsible for matters of a legal nature that affect either the property being appraised or the\ntitle to it, except for information that he or she became aware of during the research involved in performing this appraisal.\nThe appraiser assumes that the title is good and marketable and will not render any opinions about the title.\n\n2. The appraiser has provided a sketch in this appraisal report to show the approximate dimensions of the improvements.\nThe sketch is included only to assist the reader in visualizing the property and understanding the appraiser's determination\nof its size.\n\n3. The appraiser has examined the available flood maps that are provided by the Federal Emergency Management Agency\n(or other data sources) and has noted in this appraisal report whether any portion of the subject site is located in an\nidentified Special Flood Hazard Area. Because the appraiser is not a surveyor, he or she makes no guarantees, express or\nimplied, regarding this determination.\n\n4. The appraiser will not give testimony or appear in court because he or she made an appraisal of the property in question,\nunless specific arrangements to do so have been made beforehand, or as otherwise required by law.\n\n5. The appraiser has noted in this appraisal report any adverse conditions (such as needed repairs, deterioration, the\npresence of hazardous wastes, toxic substances, etc.) observed during the inspection of the subject property or that he or\nshe became aware of during the research involved in performing this appraisal. Unless otherwise stated in this appraisal\nreport, the appraiser has no knowledge of any hidden or unapparent physical deficiencies or adverse conditions of the\nproperty (such as, but not limited to, needed repairs, deterioration, the presence of hazardous wastes, toxic substances,\nadverse environmental conditions, etc.) that would make the property less valuable, and has assumed that there are no\nsuch conditions and makes no guarantees or warranties, express or implied. The appraiser will not be responsible for any\nsuch conditions that do exist or for any engineering or testing that might be required to discover whether such conditions\nexist. Because the appraiser is not an expert in the field of environmental hazards, this appraisal report must not be\nconsidered as an environmental assessment of the property.\n\n6. The appraiser has based his or her appraisal report and valuation conclusion for an appraisal that is subject to\nsatisfactory completion, repairs, or alterations on the assumption that the completion, repairs, or alterations of the subject\nproperty will be performed in a professional manner.\n\nFreddie Mac Form 465 March 2005 UAD Version 9/2011 Page 4 of 6 Fannie Mae Form 1073 March 2005\n\n\n\nRES-1809-1\nJV20220146\n\nForm 1073UAD - \"TOTAL\" appraisal software by a la mode, inc. - 1-800-ALAMODE\n\nIndividual Condominium Unit Appraisal Report File #\n\nThe Appraiser certifies and agrees that:\n\n1. I have, at a minimum, developed and reported this appraisal in accordance with the scope of work requirements stated in\nthis appraisal report.\n\n2. I performed a complete visual inspection of the interior and exterior areas of the subject property. I reported the condition\nof the improvements in factual, specific terms. I identified and reported the physical deficiencies that could affect the livability,\nsoundness, or structural integrity of the property.\n\n3. I performed this appraisal in accordance with the requirements of the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal\nPractice that were adopted and promulgated by the Appraisal Standards Board of The Appraisal Foundation and that were in\nplace at the time this appraisal report was prepared.\n\n4. I developed my opinion of the market value of the real property that is the subject of this report based on the sales\ncomparison approach to value. I have adequate comparable market data to develop a reliable sales comparison approach\nfor this appraisal assignment. I further certify that I considered the cost and income approaches to value but did not develop\nthem, unless otherwise indicated in this report.\n\n5. I researched, verified, analyzed, and reported on any current agreement for sale for the subject property, any offering for\nsale of the subject property in the twelve months prior to the effective date of this appraisal, and the prior sales of the subject\nproperty for a minimum of three years prior to the effective date of this appraisal, unless otherwise indicated in this report.\n\n6. I researched, verified, analyzed, and reported on the prior sales of the comparable sales for a minimum of one year prior\nto the date of sale of the comparable sale, unless otherwise indicated in this report.\n\n7. I selected and used comparable sales that are locationally, physically, and functionally the most similar to the subject property.\n\n8. I have not used comparable sales that were the result of combining a land sale with the contract purchase price of a home that\nhas been built or will be built on the land.\n\n9. I have reported adjustments to the comparable sales that reflect the market's reaction to the differences between the subject\nproperty and the comparable sales.\n\n10. I verified, from a disinterested source, all information in this report that was provided by parties who have a financial interest in\nthe sale or financing of the subject property.\n\n11. I have knowledge and experience in appraising this type of property in this market area.\n\n12. I am aware of, and have access to, the necessary and appropriate public and private data sources, such as multiple listing\nservices, tax assessment records, public land records and other such data sources for the area in which the property is located.\n\n13. I obtained the information, estimates, and opinions furnished by other parties and expressed in this appraisal report from\nreliable sources that I believe to be true and correct.\n\n14. I have taken into consideration the factors that have an impact on value with respect to the subject neighborhood, subject\nproperty, and the proximity of the subject property to adverse influences in the development of my opinion of market value. I\nhave noted in this appraisal report any adverse conditions (such as, but not limited to, needed repairs, deterioration, the\npresence of hazardous wastes, toxic substances, adverse environmental conditions, etc.) observed during the inspection of the\nsubject property or that I became aware of during the research involved in performing this appraisal. I have considered these\nadverse conditions in my analysis of the property value, and have reported on the effect of the conditions on the value and\nmarketability of the subject property.\n\n15. I have not knowingly withheld any significant information from this appraisal report and, to the best of my knowledge, all\nstatements and information in this appraisal report are true and correct.\n\n16. I stated in this appraisal report my own personal, unbiased, and professional analysis, opinions, and conclusions, which\nare subject only to the assumptions and limiting conditions in this appraisal report.\n\n17. I have no present or prospective interest in the property that is the subject of this report, and I have no present or\nprospective personal interest or bias with respect to the participants in the transaction. I did not base, either partially or\ncompletely, my analysis and/or opinion of market value in this appraisal report on the race, color, religion, sex, age, marital\nstatus, handicap, familial status, or national origin of either the prospective owners or occupants of the subject property or of the\npresent owners or occupants of the properties in the vicinity of the subject property or on any other basis prohibited by law.\n\n18. My employment and/or compensation for performing this appraisal or any future or anticipated appraisals was not\nconditioned on any agreement or understanding, written or otherwise, that I would report (or present analysis supporting) a\npredetermined specific value, a predetermined minimum value, a range or direction in value, a value that favors the cause of\nany party, or the attainment of a specific result or occurrence of a specific subsequent event (such as approval of a pending\nmortgage loan application).\n\n19. I personally prepared all conclusions and opinions about the real estate that were set forth in this appraisal report. If I\nrelied on significant real property appraisal assistance from any individual or individuals in the performance of this appraisal\nor the preparation of this appraisal report, I have named such individual(s) and disclosed the specific tasks performed in this\nappraisal report.

However, my experience in\nthis market finds seller concessions in this neighborhood to typically range between 3% and 6% of sale price and to be used in less than 30%\nof transactions. Frequency of use of seller concessions has remained stable.\n\nThere is a low level of foreclosure activity in this market having no impact on value.\n\nThe reported data is derived from Bright/MLS. Data is extracted using the following parameters: all\n2-bedroom condominiums in the $300,000-$500,000 price range and the noted boundaries.  See \"Price Range\" below.\n\nThe MLS is reporting marketing times for appropriately priced housing in this price segment to be under 3-months for the year. Sales volume\nhas fluctuated normally, as has inventory, continuing market balance. The average sale price has fluctuated over the past year and the market\nis considered stable overall. The current supply data indicates a continuation of stability.\nThe global outbreak of a “novel coronavirus” known as COVID-19 was officially declared a pandemic by the World Health\nOrganization (WHO). The reader is cautioned, and reminded that the conclusions presented in this appraisal report apply only as of\nthe effective date(s) indicated.

The city still reports two tax ID\nnumbers and two lot numbers (as shown on page one of the main form). The taxes shown on page one of the main form are the\nsum of public record reported taxes for each unit.\n\nThe public record reports Unit 4C to offer 580 SF and Unit 4D to offer 850 SF. My field measurements are relied upon in this\nreport.\n\nSpecial Assessment:\n\nManagement reports a special assessment to have been charged this year with four payments due (Janauary, March, May and\nJune of 2022). The remaining balance to the subject is reported to be $18,207. They report a requirement for payment in full at\nthe time of settlement following any sale of a unit in this complex.\n\nThe agent reports an additional payment due (from the units in this complex) on a loan taken by the association. She noted a\nremaining term of eight years, paid monthly (with association fee) or in a lump sum and that the subject unit owner is paying\nmonthly installments. The association fee shown on page one of the form is the base monthly fee. The loan adds an addition\n$265.51/month.\n\nThe agreement of sale reports a \"Special Assessment\" payoff range of $20,000-$30,000 to be paid by the seller at settlement.\nThe listing agent confirmed that the seller intends to pay off all outstanding balances at settlement.\n\nNeighborhood Description:\n\nThe subject is located in the desirable Old City section of Philadelphia, PA. Located just north of the central business district, Old\nCity is comprised mostly of owner occupied condominiums along with some attached 2 and 3-story houses, multi family,\nindustrial/light industrial, and commercial land uses. Compared with other center city neighborhoods, Old City includes a\nsignificantly higher than typical ratio of condominiums to non-condominium housing. Non-condominium housing comprises a\nrelatively small percentage of available housing in the area. The presence of industrial/warehouse buildings is seen as a positive\nfeature by typical area purchasers who are drawn to the unusual housing possibilities offered by these conversions. The\nindustrial and multi family uses are scattered throughout the neighborhood. The commercial uses are concentrated along 2nd\nStreet (also provides the most commonly used neighborhood access to central Philadelphia's business district), Delaware\nAvenue, 5th Street, and Market Street. Public transportation, police and fire protection are located nearby. Typical residents work\nin nearby central Philadelphia.\n\nOld City is home to many bars, restaurants, and nightclubs. These entertainment options, along with the area's proximity to the\ncentral business district and the wide mix of available housing options have drawn residents ranging from young singles to empty\nnesters.\n\nBased on the continued interest of owner occupants of all ages, investors, its close proximity to nearby center city, and reputation\nas a highly desirable area, the single family real estate market in Old City, is expected to remain stable (life cycle) in the near\nfuture.\n\nNonconforming Lot/Use:\n\nThe subject's site does not meet local ordinance as a 100% residential complex in a commercial mixed use zone. The\ncommercial mixed use zone requires that at least some portion of the property be designated for commercial use. The subject\ncomplex is 100% residential. Nonconforming uses are common throughout Philadelphia where the typical house predates zoning,\nis situated on a substandard size lot, and/or includes 100% residential use in a commercial or industrial zone. This has no\nadverse affect on marketability. If the subject were destroyed, the improvement could be rebuilt to its current foot print (subject to\ncity issuance of applicable building permits). See below for additional comments:\n\n(10) Reconstruction of Destroyed Structures.\n(a) Applicability.\nNotwithstanding the provisions of § 14-305(1) (Purpose) through § 14-305(9) (Nonconforming Parking or Site Improvements)\nabove, the provisions of this § 14-305(10) (Reconstruction of Destroyed Structures) shall apply when nonconforming buildings,\nuses, lots, parking, site improvements, or accessory signs are destroyed or rendered unusable by fire or an act of God or a third\nparty over which the owner has no control.\n\n(b) Rights Following Destruction.\nFollowing destruction, as defined in § 14-305(10)(a) (Applicability): (a) a replacement structure that does not reduce the\nnonconforming setbacks or exceed the nonconforming area or height of the destroyed structure may be constructed, and (b) the\nnonconforming use that existed prior to the destruction may be re-established, and (c) the property need not provide any more\noff-street parking spaces or loading areas than the property had before the destruction. These provisions shall apply only if\nreconstruction begins within three years after the destruction and is completed without interruption; otherwise the building, use,\nlot, parking, site improvement, or accessory sign may only be reconstructed in compliance with the Zoning Code for the zoning\ndistrict where it is located.\n\nSupplemental Addendum JV20220146\nStephen Boerner & Melissa Boerner\n246 N 3rd St\nPhiladelphia Philadelphia PA 19106\n1st Colonial Community Bank\n\nFrank Di Flumeri, SRA PA Cert.

Although there are comparable properties in the subject's\narea-none have sold recently. Therefore, sales in excess of six months had to be used.\n\nLocation with respect to bridge (north/south of same) has no impact on value or marketability.\nGross, net, and/or line item adjustments exceed what is typical. This is due to a lack of more similar data. These were considered\nto be the most similar sales available.\n\nThe estimated value for the subject exceeds the predominant price for the neighborhood. This is due to the subject's 2-bedroom\nlayout (the area is dominated by 1-bedroom units) and parking. It has no adverse affect on marketability.\n\nThe Intended User of the report is: 1st Colonial Community Bank.\nThe intended use is for the identified Lender/Client to evaluate the property that is the subject of this appraisal for a mortgage\nfinance transaction, subject to the stated Scope of Work, purpose of the appraisal, and Definition of Market Value.

Most importantly, the appraiser's viewing of the property is far\ndifferent from and much less intensive than the type of inspections performed to discover property defects.\n\nThe appraiser is not an expert in other fields such as but not limited to home inspection, building construction, pest control, or\nstructural engineering.
