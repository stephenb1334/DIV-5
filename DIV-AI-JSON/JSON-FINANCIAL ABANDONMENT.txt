The primary objectives are to prevent foreclosure, secure appropriate preservation credits, and achieve an equitable distribution that recognizes Stephen's extraordinary efforts to preserve marital assets contrasted with Melissa's systematic withdrawal of financial support. The framework is designed to provide multiple negotiation pathways while maintaining core principles of economic justice in equitable distribution. By focusing on the Financial Abandonment Doctrine and preservation credits rather than punitive measures, the framework creates opportunity for resolution that serves both parties' interests while avoiding the significant costs and unpredictability of protracted litigation."
