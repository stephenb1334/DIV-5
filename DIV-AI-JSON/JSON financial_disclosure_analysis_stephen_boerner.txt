C.S. § 3701 (Alimony) and § 4321 (Support). In Q1 2024, a violent home invasion triggered a clinical diagnosis of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), rendering him unable to work. This disability caused a complete loss of income, forcing reliance on savings, loans, or public assistance. The husband’s prior role establishes a history of financial provision, critical for equitable distribution under 23 Pa. C.S. § 3502. His current inability to work, coupled with an ongoing Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) application, underscores his financial vulnerability and strengthens claims for spousal support in Delaware County Family Court.",

In September 2024, she reinstated her Pennsylvania nursing license, signaling intent to resume her career. By December 2024, she commenced full-time employment at the Hospital of Pennsylvania, a former employer, but failed to disclose this material change in financial circumstances during the mandatory financial disclosure process, violating Pennsylvania Rule of Civil Procedure 1920.33 (Disclosure and Discovery). Additionally, she closed a bank account one week prior to starting employment, withdrawing all funds without documenting their destination, further breaching Rule 1920.33’s transparency requirements.
