This version incorporates feedback and anticipates potential challenges in retrieving the ideal data.\nRefined Deep Research Prompt for Condo Analysis (Version 2)\nObjective for Perplexity AI:\nConduct a comprehensive real estate market analysis to determine the fair market value of 246 N 3rd St #4CD, Philadelphia, PA 19106, currently listed for sale at $433,000 (as of February 2025). Analyze this price in comparison to:\n\t1\tComparable Properties: Identify and analyze recently sold and active for-sale 2-bedroom, 2-bathroom condos in Old City, Philadelphia (zip code 19106) and highly comparable surrounding neighborhoods (e.g., Society Hill, Washington Square West, Northern Liberties). The goal is to identify the most relevant comps. Prioritize properties with similar size, age, amenities, and crucially, parking. Explicitly note and address the potential for properties with vastly different HOA fees to skew the results.\n\t2\tMarket Conditions in April 2022: Assess the real estate market conditions in Old City, Philadelphia in April 2022, when the subject property was purchased for $400,000. Determine if this purchase price was aligned with fair market value at that time, accounting for any shifts within the first half of 2022. Compare 2022 market conditions to February 2025 conditions, including any major economic events during the time span, and quantify impact.\nKeywords for Search & Specific Search Instructions (Refined):\n\t•\tBase Keywords (Broad Searches): \"Old City Philadelphia real estate market,\" \"Philadelphia condo market trends,\" \"19106 real estate,\" \"Philadelphia real estate market analysis\"\n\t•\tSpecific Search Terms (Targeted):\n\t◦\t\"2 bedroom 2 bath condos Old City Philadelphia\" + (\"sold\" OR \"active\")\n\t◦\t\"Condo sales data Old City Philadelphia\" + (2022 OR 2025) + (\"parking\" OR \"parking space\")\n\t◦\t\"Commons of New St condos Philadelphia\" + (\"sales history\" OR \"HOA fees\" OR \"amenities\") (If possible, search for building-specific information)\n\t◦\t\"Market report Philadelphia\" + (2022 OR 2025) + (\"condos\" OR \"housing\") + (\"interest rates\" OR \"inventory\") (Look for official reports, if any)\n\t◦\t\"Parking space rental rates Old City Philadelphia\" + (2024 OR 2025) + \"213 New St\" (If possible, try to find data specifically for the vicinity)\n\t◦\t\"HOA fees Philadelphia condos\" + (comparisons OR averages OR ranges)\n\t◦\t\"Days on Market Philadelphia condos\" + (2022 OR 2025) + (median OR average)\n\t◦\t\"Interest rate impact on Philadelphia real estate\" + (2022 to 2025) + (\"condos\" OR \"housing\")\n\t◦\t\"Philadelphia construction activity\" + (\"Old City\" OR \"Center City\") + (2022 to 2025) + (\"parking\" OR \"impact on real estate\")\n\t•\tInstructions:\n\t◦\tPrioritize data from reputable real estate websites (Zillow, Redfin, Realtor.com, Bright MLS) and official market reports (if available) for Philadelphia.\n\t◦\tWhen searching for \"comparable sales,\" explicitly instruct Perplexity to filter for sales data from 2022 and February 2025.\n\t◦\tSearch for \"comparable listings\" within the specified Old City and comparable areas.\n\t◦\tLook for data points regarding the number of days that properties are listed as active.\nBackground Information (Provide Context for Perplexity AI - Enhanced):\n\t•\tProperty Address: 246 N 3rd St #4CD, Philadelphia, PA 19106\n\t•\tBuilding: Commons of New St. in Old City\n\t•\tProperty Type: Condo, originally two 1BR/1BA units merged into a 2BR/2BA. Note the potential impact of the merged unit on buyer perception and valuation.\n\t•\tKey Features: Two deeded parking spaces at 213 New St., combined HOA fees of $812.83. High HOA is a concern. Listed price $433,000 (Feb 2025), purchased for $400,000 in April 2022.\n\t•\tProperty Issues: High HOA fees, long days on market, uncertainty about HOA's future regarding the parking lot.\n\t•\tProperty Strengths: Excellent location, two parking spaces, desirable Old City neighborhood.\n\t•\tAdditional Notes: The subject property's effective square footage after the merger is not provided, so estimations will need to be made or derived from public sources.\nSpecific Research Questions for Perplexity AI to Address (Highly Detailed):\n1. Current Pricing Justification (February 2025):\n\t•\tAnalyze recent comparable sales (past 3-6 months) and active listings to determine if the $433,000 asking price reflects fair market value.

Parking Asset Viability:\n\t•\tDetermine the current market rental rates for parking spaces in Old City (specifically near 213 New St.). Differentiate rates for covered vs. uncovered parking, if possible.\n\t•\tBased on construction activity, demand, and any available local market reports, what is the potential for long-term appreciation of parking spaces/lots in Old City?\n\t•\tResearch the HOA regarding 213 New St.:\n\t◦\tIs there any information available regarding rules, meeting minutes, or announcements on the sale of the parking lot?\n\t◦\tIf a parking lot sale were to be considered, what steps would the HOA have to take?
