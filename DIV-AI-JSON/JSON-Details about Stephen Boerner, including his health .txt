  "conclusion": "Melissa's unilateral discontinuation of contributions to the jointly owned condominium, combined with non-disclosure of financial records post-2024-09-30, violates Pennsylvania family law principles of equitable distribution and transparency. Stephen's efforts to maintain the property despite disability highlight the inequity of Melissa's actions, positioning him favorably for interim relief, retroactive contributions, and a larger share of the marital estate. The condo's unsold status and foreclosure risk underscore the need for court intervention."
