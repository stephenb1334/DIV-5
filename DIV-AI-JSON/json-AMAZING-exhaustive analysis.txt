C.S. § 3701(b)(1) (relative earnings) and § 4321 (support). In Q1 2024, a violent home invasion triggered a clinical Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) diagnosis, rendering him unable to work, eliminating income, and forcing reliance on savings, loans, or public assistance. This disability, coupled with an ongoing Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) application, underscores his financial vulnerability, justifying immediate Alimony Pendente Lite (APL) under § 3702 and equitable distribution adjustments under § 3502(a)(3) (health, employability). Delaware County courts prioritize dependent spouses, particularly those disabled, enhancing the husband’s claims.",
