# Key Discussion Points for Joint Account Management

**Objective:** To address the events of May 2, 2025, and establish clear, mutually agreed-upon protocols for managing joint financial accounts moving forward.

---

### 1. The Shared Email Account (`stephenandmelissaboerner@gmail.com`)

*   **The Action:** The email forwarding from this account was intermittently turned on and off between March and June 2025.
*   **Key Question:** What was the purpose of disabling the forwarding? Was the intent to stop all notifications to Stephen's personal email?
*   **Discussion Goal:** Agree on the future of this shared account. Should it be decommissioned? If it remains active, what are the rules for its use and who should have access? Transparency about its settings is paramount.

### 2. Unilateral Changes to the Joint Mr. Cooper Account

*   **The Actions:** On May 2nd, two significant changes were made without prior discussion:
    1.  The contact email was changed from the shared address to Melissa's personal address.
    2.  A new, separate online profile was created for the joint account.
*   **Key Questions:** What was the reason for making these changes? Why was a new, separate login created instead of using the existing one?
*   **Discussion Goal:** Establish a firm rule that any administrative changes to joint financial accounts (including contact information, passwords, or user profiles) require explicit, documented consent from both parties beforehand.

### 3. Communication and Transparency

*   **The Core Issue:** The changes were not communicated directly and were only discovered accidentally because of a technical oversight (the forwarding rule being active).
*   **Key Question:** How can we ensure both parties are fully aware of all activities related to our joint financial responsibilities?
*   **Discussion Goal:** Develop a simple, reliable communication protocol. This could be a brief text or email to the other party *before* any action is taken on a joint account, such as "I am logging in to Mr. Cooper to make the mortgage payment now," or "We need to update our contact info on the account, let's discuss."

### 4. Path Forward and Resolution

*   **The Situation:** There are now potentially multiple online profiles and a changed contact email setup on a critical joint asset.
*   **Key Questions:** What is the current, exact configuration of the Mr. Cooper account? Do both parties have full and equal access? How can we restore the account to a state that both parties agree is transparent and secure?
*   **Discussion Goal:** Agree on and execute a plan to "reset" the Mr. Cooper account to a mutually-approved state. This includes confirming the contact emails on file and ensuring both parties have secure, independent access credentials.
