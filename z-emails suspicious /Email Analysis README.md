## 4. Timeline Recap: December 23, 2024 – Present
### **December 23, 2024 & February 13, 2025: Forwarding Active**
- **Activity:** Emails sent to `stephenandmelissaboerner@gmail.com` were successfully forwarded to `stephen.boerner@gmail.com`.
- **Status:** Authorized forwarding was active.

### **February 15, 2025: Direct Email**
- **Activity:** An email from Mr. Cooper regarding a scheduled payment was sent *directly* to `stephen.boerner@gmail.com`.
- **Status:** This establishes a baseline of direct, legitimate communication. It was not forwarded.

### **March 20, 2025 & June 2, 2025: Forwarding Inactive**
- **Activity:** Emails sent to `stephenandmelissaboerner@gmail.com` were not forwarded.
- **Status:** This indicates that at some point after Feb 13, the forwarding rule was disabled.

## 5. Fraudulent Activity (May 2, 2025)
On this date, forwarding from the shared account to `stephen.boerner@gmail.com` was active, which led to the discovery of the following fraudulent acts.

### **Email 1: "Your email address was updated"**
- **Sender:** `"Mr. Cooper" <DoNotReply@email.mrcooper.com>`
- **Recipient:** `stephenandmelissaboerner@gmail.com`
- **Forwarding Status:** Forwarded to `stephen.boerner@gmail.com`.
- **Evidence:** Email headers (`X-Forwarded-For`) confirm the forwarding path. The email body explicitly states that the contact email for the account was changed to the fraudulent `melissabemer@gmail.com`.

### **Email 2: "Here’s your account activation link, Melissa Bemer"**
- **Sender:** `"Mr. Cooper" <DoNotReply@email.mrcooper.com>`
- **Recipient:** `stephenandmelissaboerner@gmail.com`
- **Forwarding Status:** Forwarded to `stephen.boerner@gmail.com`.
- **Evidence:** Email headers confirm the forwarding path. The subject line and body are addressed to "Melissa Bemer," a fraudulent identity, and contain an account activation link. This was an attempt to create a new online profile tied to the fraudulent email.

## 6. Key Findings
- **Forwarding Behavior:**
  - Authorized forwarding from `stephenandmelissaboerner@gmail.com` to `stephen.boerner@gmail.com` was intermittently active.
  - It was active on May 2, 2025, which was critical for discovering the fraud. It was inactive during tests in March and June 2025.
  - This intermittent status may suggest tampering with account settings by an unauthorized party.
- **Suspicious Activity:**
  - **Unauthorized Account Modification:** On May 2, the contact email for the Mr. Cooper account was changed from `stephenandmelissaboerner@gmail.com` to the unauthorized `melissabemer@gmail.com`.
  - **Attempted Identity Fraud:** The creation of the identity "Melissa Bemer" (a phonetic/visual alteration of Boerner) and the attempt to activate a new online account under this name constitutes attempted identity fraud. The goal was likely to seize control of the account and intercept communications.

## 7. Next Steps
- **Further Analysis:**
  - Secure all related accounts (`stephen.boerner@gmail.com`, `stephenandmelissaboerner@gmail.com`) by changing passwords and enabling Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA).
  - Contact Mr. Cooper to report the fraud, revert the unauthorized email change, and investigate any other changes made to the account.
  - Preserve all email evidence, including full headers, for legal purposes.
- **Testing:**
  - Continue testing forwarding behavior using controlled emails.
  - Monitor for anomalies in email delivery or forwarding headers.
- **Documentation:**
  - Maintain a detailed chain of custody for all digital evidence.
