LEGAL ANALYSIS
Pennsylvania Marital Property Principles
Under 23 Pa.C.S.A. 3501, the condominium constitutes marital property subject to equitable distribution. Per Sutliff v. Sutliff, 543 A.2d 534 (Pa. 1988), parties maintain fiduciary duty to preserve marital assets during pendency of divorce proceedings. The opposing party's unilateral cessation of financial contributions absent court approval constitutes potential dissipation of marital assets under Verholek v. Verholek, 741 A.2d 792 (Pa. Super. 1999).

Financial Disclosure Requirements
Delaware County Court of Common Pleas enforces strict compliance with Pa.R.C.P. 1920.33 requiring full financial disclosure. The Pennsylvania Superior Court in Creeks v. Creeks, 619 A.2d 754 (Pa. Super. 1993) established that deliberate non-disclosure warrants sanctions including adverse inference against non-compliant party. The opposing party's failure to disclose post-September banking information and employment constitutes sanctionable conduct under local rules and established precedent.

Alimony Considerations
Under 23 Pa.C.S.A. 3701, courts may award alimony based on multiple factors including:

Respective earnings and earning capacities of parties
Sources of income including retirement benefits
Duration of marriage (approximately 5 years)
Contribution by one party to education, training or increased earning power of other party
Extent to which earning power, expenses or financial obligations of party will be affected by serving as custodian of minor child
The opposing party's commencement of employment in December 2024 while client remains unable to work due to documented disability creates significant income disparity meriting alimony award under Harasym v. Harasym, 610 A.2d 1020 (Pa. Super. 1992).

RECOMMENDATION FOR LEGAL STRATEGY
Based on this comprehensive financial analysis and applicable Delaware County and Pennsylvania jurisprudence, we recommend the following legal strategy:

File Emergency Motion for Interim Relief:

Pursuant to 23 Pa.C.S.A. 3502(f), seek immediate court intervention regarding property maintenance
Request retroactive contribution from opposing party for 50% of property expenses since October 1, 2024
Petition for sanctions due to non-disclosure under Pa.R.C.P. 1920.33
Pursue Maximum Alimony Award:

Document client's disability status and inability to maintain self-sufficiency
Emphasize opposing party's deliberate termination of health insurance coverage
Highlight opposing party's undisclosed employment and earning capacity
Request Court-Supervised Property Sale:

Petition court to order immediate sale of condominium to prevent foreclosure
Seek equitable distribution adjustment accounting for client's disproportionate property expense burden
Request reimbursement for bridge loan necessitated by opposing party's non-contribution
Demand Comprehensive Financial Disclosure:

File motion to compel production of all banking records from September 23, 2024 through December 31, 2024
Seek verification of employment commencement date and compensation structure
Request adverse inference regarding $3,790.35 withdrawal absent documentation of disposition
CONCLUSION
The financial analysis demonstrates systematic financial concealment by opposing party including strategic account closure, undisclosed employment, and deliberate fund transfers designed to minimize apparent assets during divorce proceedings. Under Delaware County precedent and Pennsylvania family law statutes, these actions constitute sanctionable conduct warranting pursuit of maximum alimony award, equitable property distribution favoring client, and potential monetary sanctions for disclosure violations.

The immediate filing of emergency motions for interim relief and comprehensive disclosure is recommended to preserve client's financial position and prevent further deterioration of marital assets.
