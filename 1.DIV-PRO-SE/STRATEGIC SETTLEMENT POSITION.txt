IX. STRATEGIC RECOMMENDATION
Based on Delaware County precedent and the strength of documentation, we recommend:

Immediate Emergency Action: File emergency motion within 24 hours
Two-Track Approach: Pursue both court intervention and settlement simultaneously
Documentation Priority: Complete financial timeline with all contribution evidence
Settlement Position: Begin at maximum position (56.3% distribution) with room to negotiate
Trial Preparation: Proceed with evidence preparation while pursuing settlement
The Triple Necessity Framework provides exceptional leverage in Delaware County courts. The combination of disability, financial emergency, and foreclosure risk creates a compelling case for immediate intervention. The documented 88.9% vs. 11.1% contribution disparity, coupled with health insurance termination during active PTSD treatment, establishes a strong position for both interim relief and favorable final distribution.

DELAWARE COUNTY STRATEGIC NOTE: Delaware County judges have consistently recognized preservation credits when supported by comprehensive documentation. The extreme disparity in this case (100% vs. 0% since October 2024) exceeds the threshold established in previous successful cases. Focus on Judge Angelos's language in Johnston regarding "equity demands recognition" when one spouse bears the "entire financial burden."
