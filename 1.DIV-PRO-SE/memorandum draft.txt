RE: Melissa Bemer v. Stephen Boerner, Docket #2024-007234
TO: Carolyn R. Mirabile, Esquire, Weber Gallagher Simpson Stapleton Fires & Newby LLP
FROM: Stephen J. Boerner, Pro Se
DATE: June 2025

I. PROCEDURAL POSTURE AND NOTICE

This memorandum is submitted to clarify the factual record ahead of mediation and to provide formal notice of my intent to file multiple motions with the Delaware County Office of Judicial Support under Local Rule 206.8 if a comprehensive resolution is not achieved. Following the withdrawal of prior counsel in May 2025, I proceed in this matter pro se, with a clear understanding of Pennsylvania family law and the procedural requirements of Delaware County.

Litigation Roadmap: Mediation → Master Appointment (if necessary) → Equitable Distribution Hearing. All contemplated motions will comply with Delaware County Local Rules and OJS filing procedures.

II. FACTUAL FOUNDATION
A. Acquisition of Marital Property

The marital condominium at 246 N. 3rd St. #4CD, Philadelphia, PA, was acquired on April 15, 2022, for $400,000. My initial financial contributions to this marital asset were substantial:

My down payment: $40,000 (10% of purchase price)

My closing costs: $23,340 (See Exhibit B, Closing Disclosure, p.1)

My total initial investment: $63,340.

B. Post-Separation Preservation Burden

Since October 1, 2023, I have solely borne the financial responsibility for maintaining the marital property. This burden intensified following our separation and the subsequent vacancy of the condominium.

Total Documented Preservation Payments: My direct payments for property preservation total $29,400.

C. Bridge Loan for Preservation

In January 2025, facing mounting expenses and a lack of contribution from Wife, I secured a $12,500 personal loan to continue preserving the marital property (See Exhibit C, Bridge Loan Documentation). This loan was a direct necessity to maintain the property in good standing with lenders, the HOA, and the City of Philadelphia, preventing foreclosure. This debt, incurred for the preservation of a marital asset, constitutes marital debt under 23 Pa.C.S. § 3501(b).

D. Occupancy Clarification

Your firm's email dated March 17, 2025, at 8:55 AM, stated:

"He also says he is no longer paying the mortgage beginning this month even though your client has been living at the condo."

This assertion that I (Stephen Boerner) have been "living at the condo" is factually incorrect. My primary residence is with my parents in Rock Hall, Maryland, where I have resided since July 28, 2024, as confirmed by Melissa Bemer's own Interrogatory Answer (Exhibit I, Melissa Bemer's Interrogatory Answer, Page 5, Question 9). Since the condominium became vacant on October 1, 2024, I have spent a total of 8 nights at the property: two nights for personal reasons and six nights for necessary property maintenance and showings (See Exhibit D, Bank Statements; Exhibit N, Stephen Boerner's Email to Maria Testa, March 17, 2025, 10:18 AM). This limited, documented occupancy is for the sole purpose of preserving the marital asset and does not constitute residency.

E. Economic Impact of Wife’s Employment Termination

On July 29, 2024, Wife voluntarily resigned from her nursing employment in Florida. This action directly triggered the immediate termination of my employer-provided health insurance benefits, effective August 1, 2024. This occurred while I was under active treatment for PTSD and ADHD, a diagnosis confirmed on June 12, 2024, following a violent home invasion on March 26, 2024 (See Exhibit F, PTSD/ADHD Medical Records; Exhibit G, Insurance Termination Notice). The abrupt loss of health coverage imposed significant and unforeseen medical and financial burdens on me, directly impacting my ability to focus on work and maintain financial stability.

F. Wife's Contradictory Statement on Education Contribution

Melissa Bemer's Interrogatory Answer (Exhibit I, Page 3, Question 5(a)) contains a contradictory statement regarding my contribution to her education. She initially states, "I did not contribute to my spouse's education," but immediately thereafter states, "Yes. I believe he contributed approximately $3,000 towards my education in 2021." This inconsistency raises questions about the accuracy and reliability of her disclosures.

III. LEGAL FRAMEWORK AND EQUITABLE CONSIDERATIONS
A. Preservation Credits (23 Pa.C.S. § 3502(a)(6))

Pennsylvania law explicitly mandates that courts consider the "contribution or dissipation of each party in the acquisition, preservation, depreciation or appreciation of the marital property" when equitably distributing assets (23 Pa.C.S. § 3502(a)(6)). The Superior Court, in Biese v. Biese, 979 A.2d 892 (Pa. Super. 2009), affirmed that a spouse is entitled to equitable credits for post-separation payments made to preserve marital property, particularly when such payments exceed the fair rental value received. My documented payments of $29,400 directly preserved the condominium's value and prevented its deterioration or foreclosure.

Application: I am entitled to substantial preservation credits for the $29,400 in direct payments and the $12,500 bridge loan incurred to protect the marital asset.

B. Dissipation and Concealment of Marital Assets (23 Pa.C.S. § 3502(a)(6))

Wife's actions demonstrate a pattern of financial misconduct and dissipation:

Unilateral Cessation of Contributions: Wife unilaterally ceased all financial contributions to the jointly owned marital condominium from October 1, 2024, onwards. This forced me to bear the entire $3,500 monthly burden, placing the property at risk of foreclosure.

Financial Concealment: Wife closed her Santander bank account on September 23, 2024, with a $3,790.35 withdrawal, and deposited a $1,500 check into an undisclosed new bank account on August 20, 2024 (See Exhibit E, Santander Account Closure Records). She has failed to disclose the new banking institution or provide comprehensive income records for December 2024 to the present, despite commencing full-time employment in December 2024. This deliberate concealment of funds and income is a direct violation of discovery obligations and constitutes dissipation.

Application: Wife's actions warrant an adverse adjustment in equitable distribution, reflecting her dissipation and concealment of marital assets.

C. Health and Earning Capacities (23 Pa.C.S. § 3502(a)(3))

Pennsylvania law requires courts to consider the "age, health, station, amount and sources of income, vocational skills, employability, estate, liabilities and needs of each of the parties" (23 Pa.C.S. § 3502(a)(3)). My diagnosis of PTSD and ADHD, coupled with my inability to work and reliance on a pending SSDI application, creates a significant economic disparity between the parties. Wife's voluntary termination of my health insurance benefits further exacerbates my economic vulnerability.

Application: My current health and diminished earning capacity, contrasted with Wife's full-time employment as a Registered Nurse, support a favorable equitable distribution and an award of alimony.

D. Marital Debt Classification (Hicks v. Kubit, 758 A.2d 202)

The $12,500 bridge loan I incurred to preserve the marital property constitutes marital debt under 23 Pa.C.S. § 3501(b). Hicks v. Kubit, 758 A.2d 202 (Pa. Super. 2000), establishes that debts incurred for the preservation of marital assets are subject to equitable allocation based on the benefit received by the marital estate.

Application: This $12,500 debt should be equitably allocated between the parties.

IV. DELAWARE COUNTY MOTION STRATEGY AND RELIEF SOUGHT

If a comprehensive settlement is not achieved through good-faith mediation, I will promptly file the following coordinated motions with the Delaware County Office of Judicial Support, ensuring full compliance with Local Rule 206.8 and all OJS filing procedures.

A. Emergency Motion for Interim Relief (23 Pa.C.S. § 3502(f))

Basis: The imminent risk of foreclosure on the marital condominium, coupled with my depleted financial resources due to Wife's non-contribution, constitutes an ongoing financial emergency that threatens the marital estate. Pennsylvania law permits courts to "enter an order providing for an interim partial distribution or assignment of marital property" (23 Pa.C.S. § 3502(f)).

Relief Sought:

Immediate Reimbursement: An order compelling Wife to immediately reimburse me for $14,700 (50% of the $29,400 in preservation payments I have solely made).

Emergency Funds: An order for Wife to contribute her 50% share of ongoing monthly property costs ($1,750/month) to prevent further financial deterioration and foreclosure.

Asset Preservation: An order preserving the marital asset pending final distribution.

B. Motion for Preliminary Injunction (Pa.R.C.P. 1920.43 & 1531)

Authority: Courts in this jurisdiction may issue preliminary injunctions under Pa.R.C.P. 1920.43 and 1531 to prevent irreparable harm, particularly when asset dissipation or concealment is demonstrated.

Relief Sought:

Account Freeze: An order freezing any undisclosed accounts held by Wife, including the new financial institution receiving funds from her closed Santander account.

Transfer Prevention: An order preventing further transfers or dissipation of marital assets by Wife pending equitable distribution.

Dual Control: An order requiring dual control for any remaining marital accounts.

Irreparable Harm Standard: Concealed assets face a high risk of dissipation; once spent, recovery is often impossible, causing irreparable harm to the marital estate.

C. Alimony Pendente Lite (APL) Petition (23 Pa.C.S. § 3702)

Filing Protocol: An immediate petition will be filed with the Delaware County Domestic Relations Office for a support conference.

Basis: My current inability to work due to a documented disability (PTSD, ADHD) and my ongoing SSDI application create a significant income disparity with Wife, who is now employed full-time as a Registered Nurse. APL is designed to maintain financial parity between the parties during the pendency of the divorce action, without regard to marital fault (23 Pa.C.S. § 3702).

Calculation: APL will be calculated based on Pennsylvania's support guidelines, considering the income differential between the parties.

D. Discovery Sanctions Motion (Pa.R.Civ.P. 4019 & 23 Pa.C.S. § 3505(d))

Violations Documented: Wife has failed to comply with discovery obligations by:

Failing to disclose the new financial institution where funds from her closed Santander account were transferred.

Failing to provide full income records from her resumed employment in December 2024 to the present.

Concealing account transfers and financial activity post-September 2024.

Sanctions Requested: Under Pa.R.Civ.P. 4019, courts may impose sanctions for willful discovery violations. Additionally, 23 Pa.C.S. § 3505(d) permits the court to "deem the property to have been distributed to the party who transferred or otherwise disposed of the property" or to "order the party to pay to the other party that party's share of the marital property." Sanctions sought will include:

Evidentiary Preclusion: Precluding Wife from presenting evidence on asset valuations related to concealed funds.

Adverse Inference: Requesting the court to draw an adverse inference regarding the nature and amount of concealed funds.

Cost Reimbursement: Seeking reimbursement for all costs incurred due to Wife's discovery violations.

Asset Forfeiture/Reallocation: Requesting the court to deem concealed property distributed to Wife or to reallocate marital assets in my favor.

V. STRATEGIC POSITIONING FOR MEDIATION
A. Documented Leverage Points

My position is fortified by verifiable facts and controlling legal principles:

Preservation Credits: $29,400 in documented payments, plus a $12,500 marital debt for preservation, warrant significant credit.

Financial Misconduct: Wife's account concealment and refusal to contribute are demonstrable acts of bad faith.

Emergency Relief: The imminent foreclosure risk creates a compelling need for immediate court intervention.

Discovery Violations: Wife's non-disclosure is subject to severe sanctions under Pennsylvania law.

Medical Vulnerability: My documented PTSD and ADHD, coupled with the loss of health insurance due to Wife's actions, are critical economic factors.

B. Delaware County Settlement Context

Courts in this jurisdiction prioritize good-faith mediation efforts and expect full transparency from both parties. Wife's pattern of concealment and non-cooperation undermines her negotiating position and exposes her to significant sanctions.

C. Reasonable Resolution Framework

A reasonable resolution must include:

Preservation Credit Recognition: Full credit for my $29,400 in preservation payments and equitable allocation of the $12,500 bridge loan.

Retroactive Contribution: Immediate reimbursement of Wife’s share of all post-separation expenses.

APL During Litigation: Commencement of APL payments to me, calculated per Domestic Relations guidelines.

Asset Transparency: Complete and verified disclosure of all financial accounts and income within ten (10) days.

Cost Sharing: Equitable allocation of all marital debts and expenses incurred to date.

VI. PROCEDURAL COMPLIANCE AND NEXT STEPS
A. Delaware County Filing Requirements

All contemplated motions will adhere strictly to Delaware County filing requirements, including:

Local Rule 206.8 cover sheets.

Filing through the proper OJS channels.

Providing proper notice of presentation to opposing counsel.

Submitting verified petitions with all supporting exhibits.

B. Master Hearing Preparation

If mediation fails to achieve a comprehensive settlement, I am prepared for the case to proceed to a Praecipe to Appoint Master. My financial disclosures are complete, documentary evidence is organized (Exhibits A-P), legal arguments are anchored in Pennsylvania precedent, and procedural compliance is demonstrated.

C. Timeline for Resolution

10-Day Demand: I demand complete financial disclosure and a commitment to the reasonable resolution framework outlined above within ten (10) days of the date of this memorandum.

FAILURE TO COMPLY within this timeframe will result in the immediate filing of all contemplated motions seeking emergency relief, sanctions, and attorney cost recovery.

VII. CONCLUSION AND DEMANDS

Wife's financial abandonment of marital property, her deliberate concealment of assets, and her medical abandonment have created an untenable situation that demands immediate and equitable resolution. My documented preservation efforts demonstrate a commitment to protecting the marital estate, while Wife's actions violate fundamental discovery obligations and principles of good faith.

This case presents clear entitlement to preservation credits, documented financial misconduct, and discovery violations warranting decisive court intervention under established Pennsylvania law and Delaware County practice.

IMMEDIATE DEMANDS:

Complete and verified financial disclosure of all accounts and income records.

Reimbursement of $14,700 (50% of my direct preservation payments).

Commencement of APL payments to me, as calculated by the Domestic Relations Office.

Formal agreement for asset preservation (no transfers or dissipation pending distribution).

FAILURE TO COMPLY with these immediate demands within ten (10) days will result in the filing of all contemplated motions seeking emergency relief, sanctions, and attorney cost recovery.
