**Recommendation: Do NOT Add to Termination Letter**  

### Key Analysis from Delaware County Rules and Search Results:  
1. **Separate Processes**:  
   - **Termination of counsel** (Local Rule 13.01) and **requesting accommodations** (ADA Title II) are distinct legal actions requiring separate filings[3][9].  
   - **Extension requests** use specific forms (e.g., [Application for Continuance](https://delcopa.gov/ojs/EFileForms/Court%20Admin%20Forms%20for%20EFile/ElectronicFilingContinuanceForm.pdf)) and must cite procedural grounds like Pa.R.C.P. 216[11][12].  

2. **Strategic Risks of Combining**:  
   - Including accommodation requests in a termination letter risks:  
     - **Diluting focus** on attorney misconduct claims[1][16].  
     - **Premature disclosure** of PTSD to opposing counsel before accommodations are formally granted[8].  
   - Courts prefer accommodation requests through designated ADA coordinators, not adversarial correspondence[9][10].  

3. **Proper Procedure**:  
   - **Step 1**: File termination letter as-is to preserve billing disputes/disciplinary claims[1][16].  
   - **Step 2**: Separately submit:  
     - **Motion for Continuance** (Use [Form 11](https://delcopa.gov/ojs/EFileForms/Court%20Admin%20Forms%20for%20EFile/ElectronicFilingContinuanceForm.pdf)) citing PTSD-related "good cause" under Pa.R.C.P. 216[11].  
     - **ADA Accommodation Request** to Nicole Brungard (610-891-4794) using [Form 9](https://delcopa.gov/courts/ada.html)[9].  

4. **Critical Precedent**:  
   - *Dormevil v. Domestic Relations Office* (2023) emphasizes strict separation of procedural requests from substantive filings to avoid judicial confusion[16].  

**Action Plan**:  
1. Send termination letter unchanged.  
2. Within 24 hours:  
   - Email ADA request to brungardn@co.delaware.pa.us[9].  
   - E-file continuance motion with PTSD documentation[11][12].  

This approach maintains procedural integrity while protecting your rights under the ADA and Pennsylvania Rules of Civil Procedure.
