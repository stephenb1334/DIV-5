Disability Necessity Doctrine


Abandonment and Deliberate Deprivation of Healthcare:
Since October 1, 2024, Mr. Boerner has been forced to shoulder 100% of the financial burden associated with the jointly-owned condominium at 246 N. 3rd St. #4CD in Philadelphia, totaling $19,250. More significantly, Mr. Boerner is deeply concerned, and has expressed to me that it is the core matter of the matter at hand, is that your decision to voluntarily terminate your employment at the end of July 2024 had the direct and foreseeable consequence of depriving Mr. Boerner of essential healthcare coverage. As you are acutely aware, Mr. Boerner was diagnosed with a mental illness disability and was, at that time, fully reliant on the medical plan provided through your employment for his care, supervision, medication, and therapy.
Your deliberate abandonment of your employment, knowing that it would leave Mr. Boerner without access to necessary medical treatment, is a matter of grave concern and demonstrates a profound disregard for his well-being. The court will likely view this conduct as a significant factor in determining an equitable outcome.
It is also noted that as of December 2024 Mr. Boerner established a residence in the state of maryland after having to wait to be accepted in to a plan through the state of maryland, an outcome achieved on February 1st 2025 at the start of the new year, after having no health coverage for the entire period following your decison to terminate your employement. This all stemming from a decision that occurred in late july 2024. The period of time where Mr. Boerner was without access to medical coverage due to this decsion from your own hand, the circumstances will be shared with the court who, too, i am sure will find the outcome a decision you have made that will play a role in considerations for the outcome.
