Maria: My client informs me that she deposited one-half of the mortgage payment into the shared account from which PNC pulls the mortgage payment. The payment is due and your client has not paid his half. Please advise this will be completed today. My client is concerned about your client’s lack of response to the bills being due considering he was so aggressive when he wanted to change realtors. The parties have a three-month listing with the realtor your client chose. While the parties wait for the house to be sold, the mortgage must be paid.

Maria: I am sending you one of many emails my client has received regarding the sale of the condo. As a result of the emails and actions of your client the Relator is no longer the listing agent and your client has unilaterally secured a new Realtor and wants the condo price reduced significantly. He also says he is no longer paying the mortgage beginning this month even though your client has been living at the condo. Please let me know if you are free to speak today to discuss this issue.
