Juliana, happy Monday. Mr Cooper said our loan rate is not assumable per our closing document disclosures so that’s unfortunate but not a deal breaker, right?

Hi! I can’t send the listing contract until we have a price and list date set - did you two finalize those two pieces?

I can go ahead and send the seller’s disclosure to both of you to start. One will be the primary person to fill it out, and the other will initial. Is there one of you who would prefer to fill it out over the other? I can send you both the disclosure from when you purchased for reference!

Hi.

I signed the listing agreement and i completed all the detail of the sellers disclosure form. Was helpful to have Richards to reference. Thank you. 

No questions on anything from me other than you confirming i did the sellers disclosure form correctly. 

What specifically are you waiting for? Melissa had no internet last night after work and shes working today until late. She has the next couple weeks off tho if youre needing her signatures. I can’t see if she completed it on my end

Hi! Just a quick update I did sign the contract and in reviewing the disclosure I have a question:
Page 6 part 11 under plumbing system: it’s marked “yes” for B but no explanation so I think was incrrectly marked and should be a “no” let me know what you both think

➜ Replying to Melissa, 2024-07-20 11:18:21: « Hi! Just a quick update I did sign the contract and in reviewing the disclosure I have a question:... »

- The ac we replaced is situated above the guest bathroom. 

- When the ac initially died, we knew because it both lacked cool air but also leaked from a faulty condenser hose 

- it leaked into parts of the surrounding dry wall in the bathroom. Small areas were impacted. 

- I had AirMaster carve out and spackle replace that dry wall on ceiling along with replacing the entire AC unit 

- Then a section of dry wall above the shower tiling showed a wet spot post AC installation. 

- AirMaster came and only cut out that dry wall and fixed the leak coming from the new Condenser hose attached to the new AC. 

- AirMaster was too busy at the time And told me my options were for them to outsource the drywall repair or settle with me. 

- I got a handyman to clean up the ceiling back to perfection, but there remains a small hole in the drywall within the shower above the tiling 

- AirMaster sent me a check for a couple hundred dollars about two months after the fact to reimburse me

Hi! Your listing will be live shortly! I wanted to verify your HOA fee - I checked with Karen who shared the combined fee is 726.51

I just wanted to verify that it is in fact the amount you two are paying monthly?

We can only pay one of the two online and the other one (4c) we pay in lump sum as Condo Café won’t allow us to have two accounts. I went off of an wrong  number for 4C. , I should’ve just called Karen but thank you very much for doing that , but yes, that is correct

Good afternoon! I hope you both were able to receive the weekly stats email I sent earlier today. I am working on an email blast to all local agents that is set to launch this afternoon. Your tenants are also kindly allowing me to do an open house this Friday evening (first friday in old city!). I will keep you updated as we get more showings/feedback!

I have a call into AirMaster. Having someone stop by either today or likely Tuesday/Wednesday. Unless you know a handy HVAC guy that is faster. AirMaster likely to sub it out anyway. it feels like low priority. I also asked them for the warranty documentation.

Good Morning! I am shooting a message to follow up on my email this morning - are you both on board with a $5k price reduction today? The condo market is a bit on the slower side, which we talked about prior to listing, and we listed at a price that gave us the wiggle room, if needed, to make a reduction. Today marks 4 weeks and I feel it would be a great time to adjust to $460!

Hello! Just sent you both week 7 stats - I know it has been slower than hoped, I think it may be time to explore a price reduction. I know we had originally planned for $450,000 (but wanted to give $465,000 a shot based on low inventory and double parking) - I wanted to put the reduction on your radar to process. When we decide to reduce and on the figure I want to go ahead with another round of both paid and unpaid advertising  to help boost visibility!

I would be in favor of a larger reduction but would like your consideration on that. I think the south will start to realize large decreases in home prices followed by the north and we could be up shits creek because we aimed for top of market pricing during this stage. What do you think. Changes to interest rates considered here too

I think in the scheme of a large price reduction that would be more like $25k to me (which I am not suggesting). I think $10k would be healthy ,and we are at a good amount of time on the market to make that change. Decrease in rates is an overall positive. Election time always makes the market a little strange due to just general uncertainty  of who is going to become president.

Morning! Apologies on the delay I had a hectic work day then family day planned. Do you mean switch gears and rent instead of sell? If you rent for a year and continue trying to sell you are cutting your potential buyer pool significantly, as with today’s rates at list price plus HOA and taxes would be higher than the price we could currently rent it for. If easier, I would be happy to jump on a phone call with either or both of you on Monday!

----------------------------------------------------
Melissa & Juliana 246 N 3rd - Neighbor & Realtor
2024-09-22 12:02:31 to Melissa & Juliana 246 N 3rd - Neighbor & Realtor - Read

Once October 1st arrives, and every month thereafter, we will be responsible for the following:

- The full monthly mortgage amount
- The basic utilities for the vacant condo
- Two HOA fees, as usual

Additionally, in early October, we will also owe Katie and Ethan their security deposit back (just disclosing that obvious cash flow here to disclose all detail). 

I agree with you. I’ll be more clear. I also would not want to have an occupied condo with term renters while simultaneously having a condo for sale spotlighting the fixed monthly being a total higher than rental income the condo could warrant.  

For the same reasons you mentioned, as well as many other valid points, I do not propose that path either.

I have two strategies I’ve put on the table:

1) to explore the idea of completely removing the condo from the market and posting a rental ad similar to how we acquired Katie and Ethan.

2) mentioned last week, reduce the list price even further than $10k understanding the optics of it, but putting out for discussion considering our circumstances - not to advocate for it, just to learn your take 

With option 1, I understand that rental rates may not fully cover our monthly expenses. However, we carry a
tolerable monthly loss currently, and it’s a monthly loss that is sustainable and, on a monthly basis, contributes to building our equity.

Interest rates are beginning to decline, and I believe buyers are aware that the reserve has to keep reducing them. And I wonder if the same buyers know that they could purchase our condo for less next year, at lower interest rates.

My primary concern is the possibility of accruing month-after-month of mortgage dues (and other condo-related costs) in a reserved buyers market from October through ??

This risk is why I recently proposed the discussion around a more significant price reduction above the $10k we did. 

I do not anticipate our condo having a higher list price next year than it’s listed at today 

And consider circumstances outside of  emotionless market conditions, as sellers we may carry the irrational urgency to offload this condo our to quickly resolve any shared liabilities and share in the positive cash assets of a sale.

$2,900 per month in rental income (for example - currently it’s $2,800 - is $34,800 over 12 month) 

One thing I was considering as well - over the next 12 months, that $34,800 contributes more towards the principal loan amount compared to last year. the amortization table that splits interest and principal loan contributions. Not a huge deal, but our amortization table becomes slightly more favorable compared to previous year - so our take home profit might get hit with a lower sale price next year but our equity will be higher when the property sells, likely in a stronger buyer’s market albeit at a discounted list price,

Good Morning! Just got the chance to read and digest all of your points - thanks for just a clear and detailed email!

 I do want to point out that since the price reduction we have had 4 requests come in - 2 buyers commit to the showings and the other 2 canceled for various reasons.

If we do the lease route I may suggest we do a 10 month lease instead of a 12 month lease to get us more into the summer than fall season next year to sell so we can list at a more optimal time.

I agree the list price is likely not going to change (much) if we list again next year, the better part of the strategy with that is that we will hit the market at a more optimal time if the 10 month lease option is feasible on your end.

Melissa - what are your thoughts on renting the condo for another year?

Yes I was going to say my suggestion is we keep it on the market through the end of this year and see what happens with the election. Depending on which way that goes interest rates could lower which would be good. We can re evaluate after the election to see. Otherwise if we do rent it I agree with the 10month lease option like you suggested Juliana.

I will say we are approaching a slower rental season - if we want to rent it, especially at current value or higher, not would be the ideal time to list for rent. 

You’ll likely rent for a lesser amount in nov/dec as that is a time when less people are moving which can lower pricing rental wise

When you say “2 requests have come in” you’re saying four requests from a buyer’s agent (representing their client) have come in to you, the listing agent, to request a showing, of which 2 have cancelled, and 2 have taken place? - of which, there was no interest to develop into an offer, correct?

Zero rush on replying to this as it’s the mid-work day 

I’m looking at the listing detail reports. 
Friendly feedback and questions here

If I pull up all the listing emails, they highlight that week’s listing view count and your comments if any, the primary button for each email leads to the same dashboard start page 

So I get the aggregated data there. Top of funnel, it aggregates the week over week listing views across all listing platforms. Then it breaks down the views by platforms like Zillow, then it shows me where the users are Geo located when they looked at the listing

Then the bottom of funnel data. It shows me one metric of interest really. Shows me: number of open houses as “1”  and that’s the only metric I see (I’m On mobile when I view these so maybe missing something)

I get it would be a different level of product to give sellers more information - like number of showings scheduled, number of canceled showings, etc, or even better top of funnel data, but I really just don’t get any value from these reports. 

Speaking of top line data, I saw one comment mention you were running paid ads. 

Assuming you’re sending Pay per click traffic to a listing/landing page ?

do you have any data or context to share on the paid ads you’re running that contributed to the views I’m seeing? 

Curious what ad platforms you use like FB or Google AdWords?

And for the landing page for paid ads, are you sending those to Zillow? Since Zillow is dominating the listing views, I’m guessing pay ads go there.

Annoying questions I know but it fills some gaps for me in understanding your craft

We lose money each month at $2,800 rent which included the parking spots for prior tenants. Lose about $300 a month. Would love to claw some back. Not sure the comps. I recall you didn’t think getting to $3k was realistic

And is it a ridiculous idea to drop the price until we find renters? 

You mentioned having it marketed for both sale and rent might not be a great idea if I recall correctly. 

But how damaging would it be to post it at 425k, give or take, while it’s marketed for rent, and try to get at least one offer to entertain before a tenant? It would drive more showings, no? And we can always decline an offer.

Melissa & Juliana 246 N 3rd - Neighbor & Realtor
2024-10-15 15:42:56 from Melissa (+16106135939) - Read

Good suggestion and maybe 435K. I also agree with trying to rent it for $3K a month given there are the 2 parking spaces which is a huge benefit to the property. If we rent for 12 months we are in same position in terms of trying to sell next year this time of year which could be tough. That’s why maybe 6 month with option to extend and/or go month to month after that might be better?

Things to note:

Renting for 11/1 is a different market than renting for 9/1 (fall is a slower rental season) - we can aim for $2600 for the unit alone, and then advertise the parking with that for $235/spot (I have heard that the parking lot under the bridge is full making our parking more valuable). I know that doesn’t bridge too much of the gap you’d still be covering but everything helps, right? We can give it 2 weeks and adjust pricing from there, if needed.

Yes - we can list for rent and for sale at the same time!

The only downside to a big price drop is that it becomes public info - so if we drop to $425,000 then decide to rent and re-list in the spring buyers can see you previously tried to sell for $425k. Does that make sense? I feel a reduction could be good while we have it up for rent - but I would lean more towards $435k than $425k

Good Morning! I wanted to check in as we haven’t had much movement in the last few weeks. I’ve gotten a few inquires for rent - but all have wanted more than 6 months. I have gotten two inquires for sale - both wanted to do air bnb (which is not allowed per HOA rules). 

I’ve sent you some updated market data - which shows longer DOM (days on market) for condos in the area.

What are your thoughts on a $1000 price reduction to get this listing refreshed in the online searches and rent reduction to $2500 (from $2600)? I can also couple that with another open house this weekend or next.

No rush to get back to me - I hope you both had a great thanksgiving holiday!

I’m okay with $1k decrease to refresh the for sale listing. 

I would prefer not to reduce the rental amount at this exact moment and need to think about that. Please allow me a week which allows time for Melissa to consider as well.

Hi! I only spoke to the agent a little bit  - I told him I lived in the building and have nothing but positives to share. He asked if the flooring underneath is concrete and the HVAC ages - I shared all info with him and sent him the disclosures and supporting docs that you two sent over.

Let’s give them the day and I will happily check in tomorrow to get a further understanding as to where this client is with making a decision!

Great. 

Also my dad and I are coming to Philly tomorrow and then again on days between tomorrow and December 18th to fix a few things like parts of the office, the desk in there has finishings the last tenant removed, several outlets are loose to the point they are hard to use, and we contemplated putting new doors and drawers in the kitchen to improve the veneers without redoing the kitchen. Just a spruce up for good impressions. 

Given the showing went well and things can move quick I want to make sure we aren’t present for anything we shouldn’t be or aren’t mid project when we shouldn’t be. 

Please call me or text me with any evolving schedule as you learn. And let me as much in advance as things can be, I know they move quick. We will stay nimble to be able to setup and tear down quickly

And I agree with melissa. I want to have any opportunity to counter a no with a reduction without doing so too early. If $10k were to get it done, or whatever, a negotiation vs a “no” and it’s over ,  then I’d love the chance to see what would get it done

Hi Juliana hope your year is off to a good start. Any recommendations for next steps re: the condo. Should we do a price reduction again? Reach out to the interested party and offer price reduction? List the property for rent for >6 months? Thank you!

Happy new year!

I do apologize I meant to reach out to you earlier this week but ended up in urgent care on Tuesday with bronchitis and walking pneumonia 😷

Feeling better now and would love to run updated comps. 

I did reach out to the agent (Pete) yesterday and he said he’d check in with the buyer - but I have not heard back unfortunately.

Hope you’re feeling better, Juliana. Apologies such an early am text but wanted to ensure you got this 

I am just seeing your text about the showing. 

I popped into the condo last week and when I was there, I got a phone call from my dad that my mom had fallen and broke her hip 

a friend of mine was with me and offered me to leave while still on with my dad  and that he would close up for me as as we in the middle of a work call I was quickly using the space for 

he finished the call and I left in that moment leaving behind a set of condo keys. 

Mistakenly he locked the top lock in the process of securing the condo. 

He has the only key for that lock unfortunately . 

It’s the same lock that I texted you about needing a locksmith for last month when I was testing keys and the correct key ended up getting stuck while in the lock position . 

The locksmith was able to remove the key, but advised to steer clear of using it to replace it eventually.

My friend with my keys is not able to get back to the city and isn’t from the city. I have to meet him this week 

I was afraid of this happening but we have to decline showings for this weekend and I will figure out a solution so by Wednesday or Thursday, which is my goal we will be OK

Hi! Hope you both had a great weekend. Any follow up thoughts on pricing moving forward for rental+sale? Historically, I know you both know this unit was a hard resale from when Richard owned it (partly due to starting out entirely too high price wise). Condos in general have been a harder sell in the last few years with HOA fees and interest rates.

I feel a small (even if $1000) sales price reduction would be a good refresher on the market - last time we did that we got some activity. Rental wise - I feel we need to at least drop $100 off of the monthly rent due to the time of the year.

Is the follow up just  asking buyers agent if their buyers are still interested or not? 

In your world is there a chance in this moment to propose something creative so it’s a message that gets delivered to the potential buyers from their agent that’s worth relaying vs a follow up that probably won’t get the agent to tap their buyers with an inquiry on our behalf with nothing to offer them. 

Since they’ve seen the condo three times, maybe we could offer an unofficial, discounted winter price implying a winter end date to create urgency. They may have the impression that condos like ours might see prices go up come spring which this  would  imply.

Remember agents work in a commission only world - it would be unusual for an agent to bring their client to a property several times and then not follow up with them (especially when nudged!). We didn’t receive any type of offer from this buyer - going back to them with a counter to no offer would be unusual, if you have something in mind I would be happy to reach out to the agent again. You’ve bought a property - you know the feeling you get when you like something and want it - that’s the kind of buyer we want!

Hi! I highly recommend a change in the rental amount.

We are about 2 1/2 weeks from our last $1000 change - things tend to pick up after the Super Bowl, and I also want to keep on our radar that we knew this property took some time to sell last time around. 

Would you like to change from $433 to $432 and re-evaluate in 2 weeks? Our last two price reductions resulted in showings being scheduled

Second one was today and not interested. 

Looks like Saturday’s buyers are interested but hesitant with the cost for renovations. I read this is interested but only if it was a cool, renovated space… “requires more updating work than they are prepared to undertake at this point in their home search. Could be a cool space once renovated.”

Hi! I don’t think it is a pricing issue - based on comps this is really well priced. I think it is a condition issue (people tend to gravitate towards more modern homes), interest rate issue (7% is high!), plus taxes and hoa aren’t cheap either. If someone were to buy the condo at $415k, with 20% down the payment (all in) comes to about $3600, which is much more than your current payment

I don’t necessarily think it’s just a price issue either. When we bought the unit my hope was also to do renovations at some point so the fact that we are getting that feedback is not surprising. I think 415K is too low at this point esp since we originally started at 465K in August! I would agree with reducing to 430K and seeing how it goes. This is also why the reduction for renting it could help bridge the gap for some time until market picks up and maybe we can sell in time but again my goal is to sell (not rent).

Good morning - question for Juliana regarding the formula and justification used for pricing strategy for my education related to comps


Are the comps you have provided us primarily properties that are our direct competitors on the market, meaning they are similar to our property, therefore competitors, and currently listed for sale? 

Or is your comps definition/justification for pricing incorporating comps / comparable and recently sold…, as in similar enough specs to ours property that have recently been sold and is that part of your pricing strategy?

Or are you using a blend of recently sold comparables and for sale competitors?

Granted not much moving in terms of sold comps so I get competitors might be more leveraged in your formula in a down market but really not sure so I’m asking. since I see most competitors in your emails , not sold comparables , if that makes sense

Good Morning - I separated those in my two emails. The one titled “Updated - Sales Comps” are sold 2 BR comps in Old City (removed anything on Christopher Columbus Blvd as that is not a true location comp) w/ parking. There aren’t too many comps so I included 7 in this email for a better picture of the market. The ones I included have settled in the last 6 months (which is what an appraiser will look at).

The one title “Active 2 BR's with parking” are active (or recently pending) listings with the same criteria above (Old City, 2 BR, parking). 

This is a small market so I can’t put too much other criteria in or we aren’t left with any comps.

An appraiser is a third party company hired by the lender - they use the same comps I provided to value a home. An appraisal is required for any buyer getting a mortgage - they take care of the cost.

Hey Juliana quick question. From your knowledge for units that were one then combined to two like ours and the one Lauren lives in for example and I think there are 2 or 3 more in the building. Once those units got combined should we still have 2 separate HOA fees etc or someone told me that once they were combined we should only have 1 account/1 HOA fee. Do you know anything about this? Thank you!

Good Morning! I apologize I somehow missed this last message!

If we rent the unit it would make most sense to take it off of the market for at least 2 months and then resist.

The market tends to heat up after superbowl (weather pending - I know its been cold!).

I wouldn’t dive into rent to buy - that would tie you up if another buyer came during that lease time.

Were they popping in out of curiosity to see what other buildings condos looked like or were they apartment renters looking to buy? 

I have stopped in 2 or 3 open houses and was transparent about wanting to see a spot and not lead anyone to think I was a lead.

I am looking at the open house sign in sheet now - if I am remembering correctly 4-5 were local renters.

Some were just people who saw my signs and came to check out the unit.

Some were really chatty - and some people were in and out in just a few minutes.

Hi Steve! I shared the count of people who came on Saturday - 7 people/couples (although one I believe came with a friend but I only had one person per group sign in) - I don’t have a way to know who is actually qualified or not, an open house showing tends to be brief (5-10 mins) and I try to share as much as I can about the building/hoa/parking/area. For those who don’t have agents I am able to send a follow up note, if I receive further feedback from anyone who stopped in on saturday (and the showing that was outside of the open house). I will let you both know immediately

What about the showing that took place after the open house? 

I saw the open house was 11:00am - 1:00pm then there was a showing at 1:45pm also on Saturday, March 1st

Hi! Sharing some stats from the open house email I set up and sent out last week. 43% open rate is really great for an email.

I am working with marketing to set up another paid social media ad - that should be up and running tomorrow or Thursday at the latest. 

As of now, two people responded to my request for feedback from the open house - one neighbor (currently at Pennsview) said it wasn’t for them but they love the area. One agent said she didn’t know her client had planned on going and was going to follow up with him.

Hope all goes well, renting seems like best option at this point so I’m likely in favor but can see how it goes today

The 6 month limitation has been tough - I’ve had well over a dozen inquiries but they all wanted a year lease

Ok would they be willing to start at 6 months then go month to month or just want 1 year overall
