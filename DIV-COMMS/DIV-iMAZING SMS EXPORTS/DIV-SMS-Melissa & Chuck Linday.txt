Bridging a group chat for us. 

We can save Chuck from repeating details twice 

And with nearly two weeks of data now, I think it’s a good time to align

Hey Melissa I wanted to keep you in the loop with the conversation Stephen and I just had.  I have a photographer coming out to the unit tomorrow morning and Stephen is going to meet us there.  My goal is to get some better shots of the unit to help improve the online marketing which hopefully will drive more showings.  We also talked about price and I don’t think I want to reduce just yet, I think we should get the new photos up and see if we get any increased activity through this weekend.  If we don’t see a significant increase in activity by the middle of next week we should drop to $389,900 on Wednesday or Thursday to refresh the listing prior to the weekend.  Please let me know your thoughts.
