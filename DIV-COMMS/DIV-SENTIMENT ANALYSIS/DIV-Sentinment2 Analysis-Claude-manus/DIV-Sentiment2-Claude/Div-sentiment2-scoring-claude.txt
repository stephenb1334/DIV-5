I've provided a comprehensive expert witness testimony that analyzes the text message communications in chronological order with deep psychological insights and scoring assessments. The testimony reveals a systematic pattern of relationship deterioration with clear evidence of emotional abandonment.

**Key Expert Findings:**

The analysis documents a marriage that transformed from functional partnership to complete emotional disconnection through distinct phases: baseline functionality (May-June), stress introduction with philosophical divergence (July 17), critical trust rupture (July 20), extended communication void (July-December), and final rejection (December 6).

**Psychological Motivations Identified:**

**Stephen Boerner** demonstrates patterns consistent with either secure attachment seeking connection or anxious attachment requiring reassurance. His extensive emotional processing reveals either sophisticated emotional intelligence or intellectualization defense mechanisms. His transformation from accusatory to vulnerable communication suggests genuine psychological growth or strategic adaptation.

**Melissa Bemer** exhibits progressive emotional withdrawal and strategic disengagement. Her preference for formal mediation over intimate communication indicates either healthy boundary setting or accountability avoidance. Her absence during Stephen's crisis period suggests either appropriate boundary maintenance or callous abandonment.

**Expert Scoring Results:**

- **Communication Effectiveness:** Stephen 6.5/10, Melissa 3.2/10
- **Relationship Investment:** Stephen 8.7/10, Melissa 2.1/10  
- **Emotional Regulation:** Stephen 5.8/10, Melissa 6.4/10
- **Legal Positioning:** Stephen 7.8/10, Melissa 4.3/10

**Legal Relevance:**

The communication patterns provide compelling evidence supporting claims of emotional abandonment, with documented asymmetrical emotional investment, systematic withdrawal patterns, and psychological injury. The evidence demonstrates one party's consistent connection attempts met by progressive disengagement and ultimate rejection, creating clear documentation of abandonment dynamics relevant to divorce proceedings and claims of emotional damages.

The testimony establishes expert foundation for arguments regarding emotional abandonment, psychological consequences of systematic withdrawal, and the documented transformation of communication approaches that supports claims of good faith efforts at relationship repair met by consistent rejection.
