# Overview of the Deceptive Listing Agreement Renewal

## Overview of the Deceptive Listing Agreement Renewal

### Introduction

In January 2025, your listing agent presented what appeared to be a straightforward “price reduction” to your existing listing agreement. However, subsequent review of the paperwork and comparison to standard listing renewal practices suggests that the agent **effectively extended** the contract for an additional six months—without clearly disclosing that it was a **full renewal** rather than just a price adjustment. This discrepancy raises questions about **misrepresentation** and compliance with real estate laws in Pennsylvania, as well as the National Association of Realtors® (NAR) Code of Ethics.

Below is a **comprehensive summary** of key details related to this **deceptive listing agreement renewal**, **excluding** any discussion of conflict-of-interest issues.

---



## 1. Impression of the Conflict & Listing Renewal Issue

1. **Conflict of Interest (HOA Board + Seller Representation)**
    - Juliana serving on the HOA board while also acting as your listing agent is not outright prohibited, but the **risk** arises when she has access to confidential information (e.g., your delinquency) that she could use for leverage or fail to disclose as a potential conflict.
    - If she did **not** disclose her position (and the knowledge of your arrears) during the listing or renewal, that can violate **Article 4** of the National Association of Realtors® (NAR) Code of Ethics and relevant Pennsylvania regulations requiring disclosure of personal interests.
1. **Deceptive Listing Renewal**
    - Re‐signing you in January 2025 under the pretext of a “price decrease” but effectively **extending** the listing agreement for six more months is arguably **misleading**.
    - If you can prove you believed you were simply approving a “price change” rather than a full renewal, that supports a claim of unethical conduct and potential misrepresentation under **Article 2** of the NAR Code of Ethics and possible state‐level consumer protection laws.
1. **Combined Weight of Both Issues**
    - These are your **“two bullets”**: (1) Conflict of interest from her board role and undisclosed knowledge, and (2) misrepresentation of the renewed listing.
    - Together, they establish a **pattern** of unethical or deceptive behavior, strengthening your case for demanding immediate termination.

## 2. Organizations / Authorities to Threaten With a Complaint

Below is a **tiered list** of entities you can cite or threaten to contact, starting with the **most localized** (HOA board itself) and escalating to **national** and **governmental** oversight bodies.

### A. Within the Condominium / HOA Sphere

1. **The Commons at New Street Condominium Association (HOA) Board**
    - **Why**: Juliana’s dual role on the board while having a personal business interest (your listing) poses a direct conflict.
    - **Potential Consequence**: HOA boards typically have by‐laws or ethical guidelines for board members. Complaints here could put her board seat at risk, especially if she’s abusing insider knowledge or not disclosing conflicts to fellow board members.

### B. Realtor® and Brokerage Organizations

1. **Kurfiss Sotheby’s International Realty (Her Brokerage)**
    - **Why**: Brokers are liable for the conduct of their sales agents. A formal complaint or threat to contact higher authorities usually compels the brokerage to act swiftly to avoid liability.
    - **Potential Consequence**: Internal disciplinary actions, forced termination of the listing, or broker stepping in to avoid exposure to larger lawsuits or complaints.
1. **Local Realtor® Association / Board of Realtors** (e.g., Greater Philadelphia Association of Realtors)
    - **Why**: Juliana (if a member) must adhere to the local board’s Code of Ethics enforcement.
    - **Potential Consequence**: Ethics hearings, fines, mandated education, or suspension of membership privileges.
1. **Pennsylvania Association of Realtors (PAR)**
    - **Why**: PAR is the state‐level branch of the NAR; they can take up ethics complaints if the local board does not resolve them.
    - **Potential Consequence**: Escalation of penalties, broader state‐level scrutiny.
1. **National Association of Realtors (NAR)**
    - **Why**: Ultimate professional body enforcing the Realtor® Code of Ethics nationwide. Complaints typically start at the local board, but referencing NAR can underscore the seriousness of potential repercussions.
    - **Potential Consequence**: If local and state boards fail to rectify or punish the misconduct, NAR can impose higher‐level sanctions or revoke membership.

### C. State Government / Licensing Authorities

1. **Pennsylvania State Real Estate Commission**
    - **Why**: This commission licenses and regulates all real estate agents in Pennsylvania. Alleged violations of licensing law, fiduciary duty, or unethical conduct can be reported here.
    - **Potential Consequence**: Investigations can lead to license suspension or revocation, plus fines.
1. **Pennsylvania Attorney General’s Office (Bureau of Consumer Protection)**
    - **Why**: If there is evidence of unfair or deceptive acts in commerce, the attorney general can investigate under Pennsylvania’s Unfair Trade Practices and Consumer Protection Law (73 P.S. § 201).
    - **Potential Consequence**: Civil penalties, injunctions, or restitution orders.

### D. Other Oversight Avenues

1. **Better Business Bureau (BBB)**
    - **Why**: While not a governmental or licensing body, a BBB complaint is a public record that can damage the brokerage’s reputation.
    - **Potential Consequence**: Negative rating or “unresolved complaint” status harming the firm’s local standing.
1. **Local Consumer Affairs Office** (If applicable in Philadelphia or the county)
    - **Why**: Some municipalities have consumer affairs divisions that accept complaints about unethical or misleading business practices.
    - **Potential Consequence**: Additional local investigation, possible fines or public listings of complaints.

---

## 3. Key Violations & Statutes to Cite

- **NAR Code of Ethics**:
    - **Article 1**: Protect client’s interests.
    - **Article 2**: Avoid concealment of pertinent facts or misrepresentation.
    - **Article 4**: Disclosure of any personal interest in the property or conflicting position.
- **Pennsylvania Real Estate Licensing and Registration Act (RELRA)**
    - Sections addressing **fiduciary duties**, **disclosure**, and **unfair trade practices**.
- **Unfair Trade Practices and Consumer Protection Law (73 P.S. § 201)**
    - If the renewal was disguised as a price decrease, that could be seen as a deceptive act.
- **Pennsylvania Uniform Condominium Act / Planned Community Act** (68 Pa. C.S.)
    - Provisions about confidentiality, board responsibilities, and conflict‐of‐interest guidelines.

---

## 4. Strategy for Maximum Impact

1. **Demand Immediate Termination**
    - Indicate that you will **file complaints** with the above entities if Juliana (and her broker) do not voluntarily terminate the listing agreement **with no penalty** and remove themselves immediately from further representation.
1. **Document Evidence**
    - Collect emails, texts, meeting agendas, and the listing agreements to **prove** the conflict of interest and deceptive renewal.
1. **Stay Composed / Professional in Tone**
    - While it’s a “threat,” a calm and factual presentation of violations is more compelling than emotional or accusatory language.
1. **Give a Short Deadline**
    - A 48‐ or 72‐hour window to respond and comply can expedite their decision to avoid drawn‐out scrutiny.

---

**Summary**

You now have a **clear list** of organizations—from your **HOA board** to the **Pennsylvania State Real Estate Commission** and **NAR**—where you can threaten to file complaints. Paired with solid documentation of:

- **Conflict of Interest** (her board membership + your delinquency knowledge), and
- **Misleading Renewal** (masked as a price decrease),

you hold two strong grounds to demand **immediate cancellation** of the listing agreement. This dual‐pronged approach often forces brokers and agents to comply rather than risk reputational and professional damage.

## Overview of the Deceptive Listing Agreement Renewal

### Introduction

In January 2025, your listing agent presented what appeared to be a straightforward “price reduction” to your existing listing agreement. However, subsequent review of the paperwork and comparison to standard listing renewal practices suggests that the agent **effectively extended** the contract for an additional six months—without clearly disclosing that it was a **full renewal** rather than just a price adjustment. This discrepancy raises questions about **misrepresentation** and compliance with real estate laws in Pennsylvania, as well as the National Association of Realtors® (NAR) Code of Ethics.

Below is a **comprehensive summary** of key details related to this **deceptive listing agreement renewal**, **excluding** any discussion of conflict-of-interest issues.

---

### 1. Original Agreement vs. “New” Agreement

1. **Initial Contract (Prior to January 2025)**
    - The **original listing agreement** typically ran for six months.
    - At some point before January 2025, the listing was nearing its expiration date.
1. **January 2025 “Price Reduction”**
    - You were shown a document or Docusign envelope that you believed was **only** lowering the existing price.
    - In reality, the text of the agreement indicated a **new** six-month term rather than a simple amendment of the sales price within the current term.
1. **Clarity & Disclosures**
    - **Proper Practice**: A simple price modification usually does **not** restart or extend the original contract term. Instead, an agent prepares an amendment or change form referencing the existing agreement’s dates.
    - **Agent’s Approach**: By labeling or describing the renewal as a “price decrease,” you may have been induced to sign a document that actually **recommitted** you to a longer listing period **without** your full understanding or informed consent.

---

### 2. Indicators of a Deceptive Renewal

1. **Contract End Date Mismatch**
    - The final expiration date in the so-called “price drop” paperwork ended up being **six months past** the original expiration.
    - This suggests you effectively agreed to an **entirely new** listing contract.
1. **Minimal Notice of Extended Term**
    - Real estate amendments in Pennsylvania **must** clearly show any changes to important terms (e.g., expiration date, commission rate, listing price).
    - If the main document or amendment titled itself as a “price adjustment” but **failed to highlight** the new term, it raises a red flag of inadequate disclosure.
1. **Electronic Signature Practices**
    - If the document was presented via Docusign or similar, you may have signed quickly under the assumption it was merely adjusting the price.
    - **Lack of transparency** during digital signing can lead to unintentional agreement to additional clauses.

---

### 3. Relevant Ethical and Legal References

1. **NAR Code of Ethics**
    - **Article 2**: Prohibits misrepresentation or concealment of pertinent facts. Misleading a client into thinking a renewal is only a price adjustment could violate this article.
    - **Article 9**: Requires Realtors® to ensure that all real estate documents are clear, understandable, and in compliance with the law.
1. **Pennsylvania Law & Regulations**
    - **Fiduciary Duty**: Agents owe a duty of **honesty** and **full disclosure** to clients under the Pennsylvania Real Estate Licensing and Registration Act (RELRA).
    - **Consumer Protection**: The **Unfair Trade Practices and Consumer Protection Law (73 P.S. § 201)** could be implicated if the agent’s method of obtaining your signature is deemed deceptive or fraudulent.
1. **Brokerage Policy**
    - Many brokerages have internal compliance rules on how to handle listing renewals or price changes. Any shortfall in explaining the contract extension might also **violate** the brokerage’s own policies.

---

### 4. Impact on You as the Seller

1. **Extended Obligation**
    - You remained obligated to this agent (and their commission structure) for a longer period, limiting your ability to seek new representation.
1. **Continued Carrying Costs**
    - Because you believed you were simply adjusting the price for a short time, you may not have realized you would be locked in for six more months, potentially incurring additional **mortgage**, **HOA**, and **carrying costs**.
1. **Loss of Other Opportunities**
    - If the agent’s performance has been subpar, you lost the chance to **terminate** on the original expiration date and hire a more proactive realtor or adjust your strategy sooner.

---

### 5. Grounds for Challenging the Renewal

1. **Misrepresentation or Ambiguity**
    - If you have email/text evidence showing the agent describing the changes solely as a “price drop” while the document itself extended the contract, you can argue **misrepresentation** occurred.
1. **Lack of Informed Consent**
    - Under both **Article 9** of the Code of Ethics and Pennsylvania law, real estate contracts should be explained in a way that the client fully understands **all** modifications.
    - If that did not happen, the renewal may be considered **voidable**.
1. **Demand for Immediate Cancellation**
    - The agent’s failure to clearly present the new expiration date is grounds to **demand termination** of the listing agreement—especially if you discovered it only after signing and the agent never clarified.

---

### Conclusion & Next Steps

You have a **solid basis** to challenge the validity of the January 2025 listing renewal. The **key points** in your favor are:

- **The Document’s Hidden Extension**: Portrayed as a simple price drop, it allegedly **reset** or lengthened the contract.
- **Potential Violation of Transparency Requirements**: Both **NAR ethics** and **PA law** require full clarity on any major contract term changes.
- **Immediate Termination**: If you can prove you were misled or the agent failed to disclose critical changes, you can argue for **nullifying** the renewed agreement and moving forward with a new representative.

If you proceed with a formal complaint or legal action, **gather** all related emails, the original listing contract, the January 2025 document, and any messages indicating the agent’s representations about what yo

### Full Scope Overview of the Deceptive Listing Agreement Renewal

#### Introduction

The journey to uncover the complexities surrounding the listing agreement renewal for my condominium at 244-246 N 3rd St, 4CD, Philadelphia, PA, has revealed a series of events and details that suggest a deceptive approach in the renewal process. This overview is not intended as a formal letter but as a comprehensive narrative to lay out the specific circumstances I’ve faced, assisted by my AI agent, Grok 3, built by xAI. The focus here is on the deceptive elements of the renewal—omissions, misrepresentations, or lack of transparency—separate from the conflict of interest, which will be addressed elsewhere. The timeline below encapsulates every piece of evidence and interaction uncovered, providing a clear picture of how this situation unfolded and the grounds on which I stand to address it.

#### Detailed Overview

The story begins with the initial listing agreement, signed on July 18, 2024, with Kurfiss Sotheby's International Realty, represented by licensee Juliana Martell, to sell my two-bedroom, two-bathroom unit for $465,000. This six-month agreement was set to expire on January 18, 2025. The property, part of The Commons at New Street Condominium Association, was marketed as a rental unit occupied by tenants who moved out on September 1, 2024, shifting its status toward sale. The agreement included standard terms: a 6% broker’s fee, MLS marketing with VOW/IDX options disabled, and HOA management by Chancellor Properties Inc., with no special assessments noted. However, the renewal process, initiated in January 2025, introduced discrepancies and omissions that raise questions about its integrity.

The renewal agreement, signed between January 14 and 16, 2025, extended the exclusive right to sell for another six months, ending July 14, 2025, but reduced the listed price to $433,000—a $32,000 drop. This adjustment was documented in a Docusign envelope (ID: F173B3F3-39A8-428F-8C12-8406B329FA91), sent on January 14, 2025, at 3:55 PM, with Juliana signing on January 16 at 1:43:57 PM, followed by Melissa A. Bemer and Stephen J. Boerner. A key change was the marketing strategy: unlike the original, which allowed internet visibility, the renewal restricted the property and address from being displayed online, a decision not fully explained or negotiated transparently. The broker’s fee remained 6%, but the renewal document lacked complete details on payment terms, unlike the original, suggesting a potential oversight or intentional vagueness.

Parallel to this, my financial interactions with the HOA revealed a troubling lack of communication. On circa February 11, 2025, Karen Oglesby from Chancellor Properties left a voicemail about my account, followed by an email on February 13, 2025, stating a past-due amount of $2,872.64 for unit 4C, urging payment to avoid collection. This debt, tied to nine months of delinquency (likely from June 2024), escalated to $3,187.72 by March 6, 2025, per another email threatening legal action if unpaid by March 15, 2025. My response on March 6 requested documentation due to restricted email access and outdated mailing addresses (2649 Tifton Street, Gulfport, FL 33711 for 4C, and 246 N 3rd St for 4D), highlighting my struggle to receive notices. This debt, unaddressed in the renewal discussions, could impact the sale—yet no mention or consideration of it appeared in the renewed terms.

Further investigation uncovered Juliana’s nomination form, submitted on February 4, 2025, to continue her role on the HOA board (Unit #5A), where she’s been an owner-occupant since 2017 and a real estate professional. The March 5, 2025, annual meeting agenda listed a “Delinquency Update (March 2025 Status),” likely a general overview, but as a board member, Juliana had access to specific delinquency details, including mine, timed closely with Karen’s March 6 email. The renewal’s timing (January 2025) amidst these financial pressures, without disclosure or adjustment, suggests a deceptive omission of material circumstances affecting the sale.

The price reduction and marketing shift in the renewal, combined with the lack of transparency about my HOA debt, paint a picture of a renewal process that failed to fully inform me. The original agreement’s expiration on January 18, 2025, was just days after the renewal signing, yet no interim communication addressed these changes or the debt’s potential impact. The incomplete fee details and sudden marketing restrictions further indicate a lack of due diligence or intent to obscure critical terms, eroding trust in the process.

#### Exhaustive Timeline

- **July 18, 2024**: Initial listing agreement signed with Kurfiss Sotheby's International Realty, Juliana Martell as licensee, for $465,000, expiring January 18, 2025.

- **March 7, 2025**: I access renewal documents via Docusign, prompting further review.

#### Closing: Grounds We Stand On

This overview highlights a deceptive renewal process marked by unaddressed financial burdens (my HOA debt), unexplained price and marketing shifts, and incomplete term disclosures, all occurring without my full informed consent. The timeline and evidence—spanning the original agreement, renewal signing, HOA debt communications, and Juliana’s board role—establish a pattern of oversight or concealment that undermines the agreement’s validity. My grounds for action rest on the right to transparent, fair representation in selling my property, supported by the documented discrepancies and my proactive efforts to clarify the situation. This foundation, distinct from conflict of interest, sets the stage for addressing the renewal’s shortcomings and seeking a resolution that protects my interests.

1. Grounds for Challenging the Renewal





1. **Conflict of Interest Violations** - Evaluating how the realtor’s position on the HOA board, combined with her role as your listing agent, violates Pennsylvania real estate law and the National Association of Realtors (NAR) Code of Ethics due to lack of disclosure.
2. **Improper Contract Renewal** - Assessing whether the manner in which the listing agreement was renewed—under the guise of a price reduction—constitutes misrepresentation or a breach of professional obligations, thereby justifying contract termination.
3. **Legal Avenues for Termination** - Identifying the strongest legal arguments that allow you to terminate the listing agreement immediately, including whether the undisclosed conflict of interest constitutes a breach that invalidates the contract.
4. **Regulatory and Ethical Complaints** - Listing all entities (state regulators, professional associations, and consumer protection authorities) where you can file formal complaints, and confirming the legality of using these as leverage in your request for contract termination.
5. **Avoiding Legal Pitfalls in Communication** - Ensuring that your termination request and any associated threats of reporting misconduct are within legal boundaries and do not constitute extortion.

I will conduct deep research into Pennsylvania real estate law, NAR ethics regulations, and potential case precedents to strengthen your position. I will get back to you with findings and a structured approach to drafting your termination demand.

# Immediate Termination of Listing Agreement – Legal and Ethical Justifications

## 1. Undisclosed Conflict of Interest (Agent’s HOA Board Role)

**Violation of Pennsylvania Fiduciary Duty & Licensing Regulations:** Pennsylvania law imposes a fiduciary duty on real estate agents to act in the client’s best interest and to disclose any conflicts that could impair that loyalty. State Real Estate Commission regulations explicitly require that all listing agreements notify clients of the agent’s **“continuing duty to disclose in a reasonably practicable period of time any conflict of interest.”** ([49 Pa. Code § 35.331 - Written agreements generally | State Regulations | US Law | LII / Legal Information Institute](https://www.law.cornell.edu/regulations/pennsylvania/49-Pa-Code-SS-35-331#:~:text=,time%20any%20conflict%20of%20interest)) Moreover, the mandatory Consumer Notice (given to all clients) reiterates that **“all licensees owe consumers the duty to…[d]isclose, as soon as practicable, all conflicts of interest and financial interests.”** ([49 Pa. Code § 35.336 - Disclosure summary for the purchase or sale of residential or commercial real estate or for the lease of residential or commercial real estate when the licensee is working on behalf of the tenant | State Regulations | US Law | LII / Legal Information Institute](https://www.law.cornell.edu/regulations/pennsylvania/49-Pa-Code-SS-35-336#:~:text=,deposit%20funds)) By serving as a homeowners’ association board member overseeing the seller’s delinquent HOA fees, the agent had a clear conflict of interest – his duties to the HOA (to collect fees) could conflict with his duty to the seller (to faithfully represent the seller’s interests). Failing to divulge this dual role to the seller violated the agent’s fiduciary obligation of loyalty and full disclosure under Pennsylvania law. This nondisclosure is a direct breach of the agent’s licensing requirements and fiduciary duties, as he concealed a fact that **Pennsylvania regulations require him to disclose promptly to his client** ([49 Pa. Code § 35.336 - Disclosure summary for the purchase or sale of residential or commercial real estate or for the lease of residential or commercial real estate when the licensee is working on behalf of the tenant | State Regulations | US Law | LII / Legal Information Institute](https://www.law.cornell.edu/regulations/pennsylvania/49-Pa-Code-SS-35-336#:~:text=,deposit%20funds)).

**NAR Code of Ethics – Duty to Disclose Conflicts:** If the agent is a REALTOR® (member of the National Association of Realtors), the NAR Code of Ethics imposes parallel duties. **Article 1** of the Code obligates REALTORS® to protect and promote the client’s interests above all else, a pledge that is primary to their agency relationship ([2025 Code of Ethics & Standards of Practice](https://www.nar.realtor/about-nar/governing-documents/code-of-ethics/2025-code-of-ethics-standards-of-practice#:~:text=agent%2C%20REALTORS%C2%AE%20pledge%20themselves%20to,agency%20capacity)). An undisclosed conflict like this undermines that promise. More specifically, **Article 5** of the NAR Code states that REALTORS® **“shall not undertake to provide professional services concerning a property or its value where they have a present or contemplated interest unless such interest is specifically disclosed to all affected parties.”** ([2025 Code of Ethics & Standards of Practice](https://www.nar.realtor/about-nar/governing-documents/code-of-ethics/2025-code-of-ethics-standards-of-practice#:~:text=Article%205)) An HOA board membership, in this context, is a **“present…interest”** in matters related to the property (since the agent, via the HOA, has a stake in the collection of fees and the outcome of any sale with regard to those fees). By failing to **“disclose…the existence of such interest to all parties”** as Article 5 requires ([2025 Code of Ethics & Standards of Practice](https://www.nar.realtor/about-nar/governing-documents/code-of-ethics/2025-code-of-ethics-standards-of-practice#:~:text=REALTORS%C2%AE%20who%20have%20a%20present,%28Amended%201%2F25)) ([2025 Code of Ethics & Standards of Practice](https://www.nar.realtor/about-nar/governing-documents/code-of-ethics/2025-code-of-ethics-standards-of-practice#:~:text=Article%205)), the agent breached the NAR Code of Ethics. This omission also likely violates **Article 2**, which forbids REALTORS® from **concealment of pertinent facts relating to the transaction** ([2025 Code of Ethics & Standards of Practice](https://www.nar.realtor/about-nar/governing-documents/code-of-ethics/2025-code-of-ethics-standards-of-practice#:~:text=Article%202)) – the agent’s dual role was a pertinent fact for the seller to know. In short, under the NAR Code the agent had an ethical duty to disclose any personal interest or conflict, and failing to do so is a serious ethical violation that the Code of Ethics would classify as misconduct.

**Relevant Pennsylvania Case Law – Breach of Duty/Conflict:** Pennsylvania courts have historically taken a hard line against undisclosed conflicts of interest by real estate brokers. For example, in *Onorato v. Wissahickon Park, Inc.*, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court condemned a broker’s undisclosed dual representation, calling such conflicts **“against sound morals and public policy”** ([Onorato v. Wissahickon Park, Inc., 430 Pa. 416 | Casetext Search + Citator](https://casetext.com/case/onorato-v-wissahickon-park-inc#:~:text=4,423)). The court in that case held that any agent who represents adverse interests without full disclosure bears a *“heavy burden”* to prove the client’s knowledge and consent to the conflict ([Onorato v. Wissahickon Park, Inc., 430 Pa. 416 | Casetext Search + Citator](https://casetext.com/case/onorato-v-wissahickon-park-inc#:~:text=representing%20the%20other%20party%20but,423)). In other words, Pennsylvania law expects transparency: a seller has the right to know if their agent’s loyalties might be divided. An undisclosed conflict can constitute a breach of fiduciary duty so severe that it **justifies voiding the agency relationship or any transaction resulting from it** ([Onorato v. Wissahickon Park, Inc., 430 Pa. 416 | Casetext Search + Citator](https://casetext.com/case/onorato-v-wissahickon-park-inc#:~:text=basis%20of%20the%20action%20is,agents%20profited%20from%20such%20acts)). By analogy, the listing agent’s failure to disclose his HOA board position – an oversight that kept the seller in the dark about a potential conflict – can be framed as an ethical misconduct and breach of duty of loyalty, supporting an immediate termination of the listing. The seller can argue that had they known of this conflict, they would not have entrusted the listing to that agent, and that the nondisclosure taints the integrity of the contract itself.

## 2. Misrepresentation in Contract Renewal (Deceptive Extension of Listing)

**Fraudulent/Deceptive Practice Under Pennsylvania Law:** Misleading a client about the nature of a contract extension goes beyond unethical – it likely violates Pennsylvania consumer protection laws. The Pennsylvania Unfair Trade Practices and Consumer Protection Law (UTPCPL) prohibits **“any…fraudulent or deceptive conduct which creates a likelihood of confusion or of misunderstanding.”** ([Pennsylvania Businesses Are Strictly Liable for Violations of Pennsylvania’s Unfair Trade Practices and Consumer Protection Law, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court Holds - Klehr Harrison Harvey Branzburg LLP](https://klehr.com/publications/pennsylvania-businesses-are-strictly-liable-for-violations-of-pennsylvanias-unfair-trade-practices-and-consumer-protection-law-the-pennsylvania-supreme-court-holds/#:~:text=Pennsylvania%27s%20Unfair%20Trade%20Practices%20and,2%284%29%28xxi)) Presenting a *listing renewal* as if it were merely a “price reduction” is precisely the kind of deceptive conduct this law forbids. The seller was led to believe they were only adjusting the price, when in fact they were unknowingly binding themselves to an additional six-month listing term. This deceptive inducement could be deemed a **material misrepresentation**. Pennsylvania courts have held that a contract obtained through material misrepresentation or fraud can be rescinded, and the UTPCPL specifically identifies misleading statements and omissions in the sale of services as unlawful ([Pennsylvania Businesses Are Strictly Liable for Violations of Pennsylvania’s Unfair Trade Practices and Consumer Protection Law, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court Holds - Klehr Harrison Harvey Branzburg LLP](https://klehr.com/publications/pennsylvania-businesses-are-strictly-liable-for-violations-of-pennsylvanias-unfair-trade-practices-and-consumer-protection-law-the-pennsylvania-supreme-court-holds/#:~:text=Pennsylvania%27s%20Unfair%20Trade%20Practices%20and,2%284%29%28xxi)). In short, **intentionally obscuring the true effect of the document (the extension) likely constitutes fraud in the inducement** or an unfair business practice. The law does not require the seller to have actually suffered a monetary loss at this point – it is enough that the conduct was capable of misleading a reasonable consumer.

**Pennsylvania Real Estate Commission Regulations and Licensee Duties:** The agent’s tactic also breached the standards set by Pennsylvania’s real estate licensing laws. The Real Estate Licensing and Registration Act (and the Commission’s regulations) list numerous *prohibited acts* for licensees. Two are directly relevant here: **“Making any substantial misrepresentation”** and **“Making any false promise…likely to influence, persuade or induce any person to enter into any contract or agreement”** ([Section 455.604 - Prohibited acts, 63 Pa. Stat. § 455.604 | Casetext Search + Citator](https://casetext.com/statute/pennsylvania-statutes/statutes-unconsolidated/title-63-ps-professions-and-occupations-state-licensed/chapter-13a-real-estate-licensing-and-registration-act/chapter-6-duties-of-licensees/section-455604-prohibited-acts#:~:text=registrant%2C%20in%20performing%20or%20attempting,or%20organization%2C%20of%20which%20the)). By implying the document was just a price change and not clearly disclosing that it was actually a renewal of the listing term, the agent arguably engaged in a *substantial misrepresentation* of a material fact (the duration of the contract). This trick also fits the definition of a *false promise or inducement* – the seller signed based on the false premise presented by the agent. These actions are explicitly forbidden by 63 P.S. § 455.604(a)(1)–(2) of the license law ([Section 455.604 - Prohibited acts, 63 Pa. Stat. § 455.604 | Casetext Search + Citator](https://casetext.com/statute/pennsylvania-statutes/statutes-unconsolidated/title-63-ps-professions-and-occupations-state-licensed/chapter-13a-real-estate-licensing-and-registration-act/chapter-6-duties-of-licensees/section-455604-prohibited-acts#:~:text=registrant%2C%20in%20performing%20or%20attempting,or%20organization%2C%20of%20which%20the)). In addition, Pennsylvania licensees must **“furnish a copy of any listing, sale, lease or other contract relevant to a real estate transaction to all signatories at the time of execution”** ([Section 455.604 - Prohibited acts, 63 Pa. Stat. § 455.604 | Casetext Search + Citator](https://casetext.com/statute/pennsylvania-statutes/statutes-unconsolidated/title-63-ps-professions-and-occupations-state-licensed/chapter-13a-real-estate-licensing-and-registration-act/chapter-6-duties-of-licensees/section-455604-prohibited-acts#:~:text=writing%20of%20all%20parties%20for,thereof%20of%20a%20new%20contract)). If the seller was not immediately provided a copy of the new agreement or it was buried in paperwork, that could be another regulatory violation. Even if a copy was given, the agent’s failure to explain that it extended the term violates the spirit of transparency required in all brokerage agreements.

**NAR Code of Ethics – Honesty and Clarity in Contracts:** Deceptive renewal practices clash with multiple REALTOR® ethical standards. **Article 1** requires REALTORS® to deal honestly and put the client’s interests first – here, there was a clear lapse in honesty by not being forthright about the contract extension. **Article 9** of the NAR Code is particularly on point: it mandates that **“for the protection of all parties, REALTORS® shall assure whenever possible that all agreements…are in writing in clear and understandable language…expressing the specific terms, conditions, obligations and commitments of the parties. A copy of each agreement shall be furnished to each party upon signing.”** ([2025 Code of Ethics & Standards of Practice](https://www.nar.realtor/about-nar/governing-documents/code-of-ethics/2025-code-of-ethics-standards-of-practice#:~:text=Article%209)). By disguising a six-month extension as a price reduction, the agent failed to ensure the contract’s terms were **“clear and understandable”** to the seller, violating Article 9’s core requirement. This conduct also breaches the ethical duty of truthfulness in representations (related to **Article 2** and **Article 12** in spirit). In summary, both Pennsylvania’s professional standards and the NAR Code demand candor with clients – any renewal or extension must be transparently negotiated and documented. The agent’s sleight-of-hand renewal is tantamount to misrepresentation and is unethical **by industry standards** as well as unlawful **by Pennsylvania statutes**.

**Basis for Termination Due to Deception:** Because the listing was renewed through misleading conduct, the seller has strong grounds to assert that the extension is void or voidable. In contract law, if a party is induced to sign an agreement (or a renewal) by fraud or material misrepresentation, that agreement **can be rescinded** at the election of the deceived party ([What is fraudulent misrepresentation? | Very Law](https://www.verylaw.com/blog/what-is-fraudulent-misrepresentation/#:~:text=Fraudulent%20Misrepresentation%20in%20Contract%20Law)). Here, the seller’s consent to the six-month extension was not informed or real – it was obtained under false pretenses. Pennsylvania contract law and equity allow for rescission in such cases, effectively undoing the contract as if it never existed. Thus, the seller can declare the renewal **null and void due to fraud**, which means they should be free to terminate the listing immediately. Even absent a court declaration, raising this issue with the brokerage (backed by the clear evidence of deception) should give the broker ample reason to release the seller to avoid potential legal liability for fraud.

## 3. Legal Grounds for Immediate Termination (No Commission or Holdover Liability)

**Material Breach by Agent Voids the Agreement:** Under basic contract principles, when one party (here, the broker/agent) commits a material breach of the agreement, the other party (the seller) is justified in terminating the contract. The agent’s undisclosed conflict of interest and the misrepresentation in securing the renewal are material breaches going to the heart of the agency relationship – trust and honest dealing. Pennsylvania courts have recognized that a broker’s breach of fiduciary duty or fraud in a real estate transaction vitiates the broker’s right to enforce the contract. In practical terms, the **listing agreement is voidable at the seller’s option** due to these breaches. The seller can elect to **rescind** (cancel) the contract effective immediately, relieving both parties of further obligations. Importantly, when a contract is rescinded for fraud or breach of fiduciary duty, the goal is to put the parties back to their pre-contract positions – which means **the broker cannot claim a commission or enforce any holdover clause**, because the contract is treated as if it never validly existed ([What is fraudulent misrepresentation? | Very Law](https://www.verylaw.com/blog/what-is-fraudulent-misrepresentation/#:~:text=Fraudulent%20Misrepresentation%20in%20Contract%20Law)).

**Undisclosed Conflict = Fiduciary Breach (Forfeiture of Commission):** A real estate agent’s fiduciary duties (loyalty, disclosure, good faith) are not just ethical ideals; they are enforceable legal obligations in Pennsylvania. If an agent breaches those duties, the law often penalizes the agent by denying them any benefits from the agency. Notably, courts have held that an agent who acts disloyally or in bad faith forfeits the right to compensation for their services ([[PDF] Restatement Third of Agency § 8.01 - Fiduciary Law Blog](https://www.fiduciarylawblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Restatement-801.pdf#:~:text=,payable%20to%20the%20agent)). This principle is echoed in the Restatement (Third) of Agency, which provides that an agent who breaches loyalty may be required to disgorge any commission earned from the disloyal transaction ([[PDF] Restatement Third of Agency § 8.01 - Fiduciary Law Blog](https://www.fiduciarylawblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Restatement-801.pdf#:~:text=,payable%20to%20the%20agent)). In our scenario, the agent’s conduct (hiding his HOA-board role and deceiving the seller on the contract terms) is a breach of the duty of loyalty and honesty so fundamental that it **disqualifies the agent from earning a commission** on this listing. The seller can assert that, due to the agent’s misconduct, the brokerage has **materially breached the listing agreement, freeing the seller from any obligation to pay commission** even if a buyer is later procured. Essentially, one cannot benefit from one’s own wrongdoing; the law will not enforce the commission clause of a tainted contract.

**Contract Rescission for Fraud/Misrepresentation:** Pennsylvania law permits rescission of contracts induced by fraud or essential misrepresentations. In such cases, the contract is considered void ab initio (from the beginning) once the defrauded party repudiates it. The seller here can formally notify the broker that they are rescinding the listing agreement (particularly the renewal) on grounds of fraudulent inducement and breach of fiduciary duty. That rescission entitles the seller to treat the contract as **terminated immediately**, and any restrictive clauses (like a holdover period where the broker could claim a commission on a later sale) become unenforceable. The **Pennsylvania Supreme Court’s stance in similar contexts** bolsters this position – for instance, in cases of undisclosed dual agency or self-dealing, the courts have not hesitated to cancel the broker’s contracts and even undo sales to remedy the breach ([Onorato v. Wissahickon Park, Inc., 430 Pa. 416 | Casetext Search + Citator](https://casetext.com/case/onorato-v-wissahickon-park-inc#:~:text=basis%20of%20the%20action%20is,agents%20profited%20from%20such%20acts)). While our matter is a listing agreement (not a completed sale), the same logic applies: a fiduciary’s breach voids their authority.

Given these points, the strongest legal argument is: **the agent’s actions amount to a material breach and fraudulent inducement, entitling the seller to an immediate termination (rescission) of the listing agreement with no further liability.** The undisclosed conflict of interest is a material fact that was withheld – a breach that undermines the validity of the contract. Likewise, the deceptive renewal means there was never a “meeting of the minds” on extending the contract, rendering that extension invalid. Thus, the seller can terminate unilaterally for cause. As a practical matter, putting this argument forward to the broker (with citations to the above laws and ethical rules) should prompt the broker to release the seller from the agreement to mitigate the risk of legal consequences.

## 4. Regulatory and Ethical Complaint Avenues (Leverage and Legality)

If the brokerage is unwilling to release the seller voluntarily, the seller has multiple avenues to file complaints and reports. Making the broker/agent aware of these potential consequences can provide leverage in negotiations for termination. Below are the relevant authorities and considerations:

- **Pennsylvania State Real Estate Commission:** This is the licensing authority that oversees real estate brokers and salespersons in Pennsylvania. The Commission can investigate and discipline licensees for violations of the Real Estate Licensing and Registration Act and its regulations. The agent’s failure to disclose a conflict of interest and the misrepresentation in the contract are grounds for disciplinary action (e.g. license suspension or fines) under the Act’s prohibited conduct provisions ([Section 455.604 - Prohibited acts, 63 Pa. Stat. § 455.604 | Casetext Search + Citator](https://casetext.com/statute/pennsylvania-statutes/statutes-unconsolidated/title-63-ps-professions-and-occupations-state-licensed/chapter-13a-real-estate-licensing-and-registration-act/chapter-6-duties-of-licensees/section-455604-prohibited-acts#:~:text=registrant%2C%20in%20performing%20or%20attempting,or%20organization%2C%20of%20which%20the)). A **formal complaint can be filed** with the Commission outlining the agent’s violations (citing the specific regs such as 49 Pa. Code § 35.331(a)(6) on conflicts and 63 P.S. § 455.604 on misrepresentation). The Commission will require a written narrative and any evidence; they have the power to subpoena records and hold a hearing on the matter. The threat of a Real Estate Commission investigation is often very sobering to brokers and agents, as it can lead to sanctions on their license.
- **Realtor Associations (Professional Ethics Complaint):** If the agent is a REALTOR® (member of a local board affiliated with NAR), the seller can file an ethics complaint with the local Association of REALTORS®. The complaint would allege violations of the NAR Code of Ethics – for instance, Article 1 (failing to protect client’s interest), Article 2 (concealing pertinent facts), Article 5 (failure to disclose interest), and Article 9 (not ensuring clarity of agreements). Realtor associations have grievance committees and professional standards hearings to adjudicate such complaints. While these bodies cannot award damages or cancel contracts, they can discipline the agent with reprimands, education, fines, or even suspension/termination of Realtor membership. A reference to the NAR Code in communications can signal to the broker that the agent also faces scrutiny from his peers for ethical lapses. (Note: The Pennsylvania Association of REALTORS® provides guidance on filing ethics complaints and also notes that if an agent *is not* a Realtor, then the State Commission or courts are the main recourse ([Realtor® Ethics & Professional Standards](https://www.parealtors.org/ethics-and-professional-standards/#:~:text=Realtor%C2%AE%20Ethics%20%26%20Professional%20Standards,writes%20the%20rules%20and)).)
- **Pennsylvania Office of Attorney General – Bureau of Consumer Protection:** The Bureau of Consumer Protection (within the PA Attorney General’s office) is tasked with enforcing the UTPCPL. A complaint can be filed with this office for unfair or deceptive business practices. The seller’s situation – being misled about a contract – falls squarely under deceptive practices in real estate services. The Bureau has the authority to investigate and even bring legal action in the public interest (and individuals can also bring private UTPCPL lawsuits). While the OAG typically focuses on patterns of misconduct or significant consumer harm, a complaint could still be lodged to alert them of the agent’s behavior. Even mentioning to the broker that the **seller is aware of their rights under the consumer protection law** and has considered contacting the Attorney General can add pressure, as few businesses want a consumer fraud investigation on their record.
- **Better Business Bureau (BBB):** Filing a complaint with the BBB against the brokerage is another option. The BBB can’t enforce laws, but they do act as an intermediary to resolve consumer complaints and will record an unresolved complaint in the broker’s BBB public profile. Brokerages often care about their reputation, and a BBB complaint is a public red flag to other potential clients. This is a more informal leverage point, but when combined with other actions, it shows the broker that the seller is serious about documenting the wrongdoing. The seller could also leave reviews on relevant platforms describing their experience – while not a legal action, public reviews can affect an agent’s business and thus may motivate a prompt release. (Be sure any such review is truthful and fair to avoid defamation issues).
- **Civil Legal Action:** Though not a “regulatory or ethical complaint” per se, the ultimate leverage is the seller’s right to pursue legal action for breach of contract, fraud, or breach of fiduciary duty. The seller can explicitly mention that they have consulted legal counsel (or are prepared to) and that they understand these violations give them the right to sue for relief, including rescission of the contract and potentially damages. If a lawsuit became necessary, the seller could seek to recover any losses incurred (for example, if the listing issues caused a delay in sale or other financial harm) and attorneys’ fees under the UTPCPL (which allows recovery of fees and possibly treble damages for intentional violations ([Pennsylvania Businesses Are Strictly Liable for Violations of Pennsylvania’s Unfair Trade Practices and Consumer Protection Law, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court Holds - Klehr Harrison Harvey Branzburg LLP](https://klehr.com/publications/pennsylvania-businesses-are-strictly-liable-for-violations-of-pennsylvanias-unfair-trade-practices-and-consumer-protection-law-the-pennsylvania-supreme-court-holds/#:~:text=A%20UTPCPL%20claim%20can%20bite,%E2%80%9D))). Additionally, Pennsylvania maintains a **Real Estate Recovery Fund** for consumers harmed by licensee fraud or misrepresentation – the listing agreement even references this fund ([49 Pa. Code § 35.336 - Disclosure summary for the purchase or sale of residential or commercial real estate or for the lease of residential or commercial real estate when the licensee is working on behalf of the tenant | State Regulations | US Law | LII / Legal Information Institute](https://www.law.cornell.edu/regulations/pennsylvania/49-Pa-Code-SS-35-336#:~:text=dwellings)). That fund can reimburse a victim if they win a judgment against a real estate licensee for fraud and cannot collect; pointing this out underscores that the state anticipates scenarios of agent fraud and has remedies for consumers (which bolsters the credibility of the seller’s complaints). While pursuing a lawsuit is a last resort, informing the broker that it’s on the table (and that the seller would have a strong case) further encourages the broker to avoid escalation and simply terminate the agreement.

**Legality of Using Complaints as Leverage:** It is generally lawful – and common – to mention the possibility of filing complaints or legal action as a means to persuade the other party to resolve a dispute. This is not considered *extortion* or an illegal threat as long as the complaints have a factual basis and the seller is only seeking a lawful remedy (release from the contract) to which they are entitled. In fact, courts and legal experts distinguish between **threatening to take legal/administrative action** and extortion: **“Threatening a civil suit is generally not blackmail, because it only ‘threatens’ to have an impartial mediator review the situation and decide the outcome… Demanding what you’re entitled to (e.g. your rights) in exchange for not reporting is usually not criminal extortion.”** ([Why exactly is it illegal to blackmail somebody by threatening to report them to the police? : r/legaladviceofftopic](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladviceofftopic/comments/1ajmv5g/why_exactly_is_it_illegal_to_blackmail_somebody/#:~:text=way,them)) ([Why exactly is it illegal to blackmail somebody by threatening to report them to the police? : r/legaladviceofftopic](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladviceofftopic/comments/1ajmv5g/why_exactly_is_it_illegal_to_blackmail_somebody/#:~:text=It%27s%20generally%20only%20illegal%20if,you%27re%20not%20otherwise%20entitled%20to)). Here, the seller is not demanding money or something illicit; they are insisting on being released from an agreement that the agent’s conduct has invalidated. Framing it as “I will report this wrongdoing if we cannot resolve it between ourselves” is legally permissible. The key is **tone and wording**. The seller should **avoid any language that sounds like a personal threat or blackmail** – for example, do not say “I will ruin your career by telling the Commission unless you cancel this contract.” Instead, the language should be factual and consequence-based, such as: *“I hope we can settle this amicably. If you are unwilling to honor my request for a release, I feel I have no alternative but to file a formal complaint with the Real Estate Commission and explore other legal remedies to protect my interests.”* This way, the seller is stating an intention to seek lawful recourse (a right everyone has) rather than an improper threat. It’s also wise to stick to **objective truth when communicating potential complaints**: e.g., “The agent’s conduct appears to violate **NAR Code of Ethics Article 9** and **Pennsylvania license law**; if not promptly addressed, I intend to report these violations to the appropriate authorities.” This puts the focus on the agent’s actions, not on any personal vendetta.

Using the potential of complaints as leverage is effective because it outlines the risks the broker/agent face (license penalties, ethical sanctions, legal liability) if they do not cooperate. It is legal so long as the seller does not demand anything beyond what would correct the situation. Here, the corrective action sought is straightforward and reasonable – release from the contract and assurance of no penalty. That ask is inherently fair given the circumstances, and mentioning complaints is essentially saying “I will have to formally protect my rights if you do not agree.” This is a legitimate form of pressure, and indeed it is often the prospect of regulatory action that convinces brokers to swiftly resolve client disputes. Finally, the seller should be prepared to follow through with these complaints if necessary – empty threats are not good practice. But if the case is as strong as described, simply laying out the intention to complain, backed by citations of the rules violated, may be enough to prompt a quick, clean termination agreement from the broker.

## 5. Strategic Approach to the Termination Demand

To maximize the chances of a **clean and immediate exit** from the listing agreement, the seller should approach the agent’s broker in a well-prepared, professional manner. Below is a structured plan for presenting the case:

**A. Draft a Formal Demand Letter:** The seller (or their attorney, if they have one) should write a **formal letter** to the broker (the broker of record who is the actual party to the listing agreement). It’s important to address the broker, as brokers are responsible for their agents’ actions and have authority to terminate listing agreements. The letter should be factual, concise, and firm. Use a clear subject line (e.g., “Immediate Termination of Listing Agreement – [Property Address] – Due to Agent Misconduct”) so the urgency is evident. Maintain a polite but resolute tone, indicating this is a serious matter.

**B. State the Purpose Up Front:** Begin the letter by unequivocally stating that the seller is requesting **immediate termination** of the listing agreement **without any further obligation** due to the agent’s unethical and improper conduct. Example opening: *“I am writing to demand the immediate termination of the Exclusive Right-to-Sell Listing Agreement for my property at [address], effective upon receipt of this letter, with no holdover or commission obligations, due to material breaches of duty and misrepresentations by your agent, [Agent Name].”* This leaves no ambiguity about what the seller wants.

**C. Outline the Facts – Two Key Issues:** In separate paragraphs or bullet points, lay out the **two main grounds** for termination, providing a chronological and factual description of each:

1. **Conflict of Interest – Undisclosed HOA Board Position:** Explain that *after* signing the listing, the seller discovered the agent is on the board of the HOA to which the seller owes fees. Note that the agent never disclosed this relationship at any point. Describe why this is a conflict (the agent, in his HOA role, has influence or control over enforcement of the lien/fees that could affect the sale or the seller’s finances). State that the seller feels betrayed by this lack of disclosure. To support this, the letter should cite the specific legal/ethical requirement to disclose conflicts. For instance: *“Pennsylvania law **requires** real estate licensees to disclose any conflict of interest to their clients in a timely manner ([49 Pa. Code § 35.336 - Disclosure summary for the purchase or sale of residential or commercial real estate or for the lease of residential or commercial real estate when the licensee is working on behalf of the tenant | State Regulations | US Law | LII / Legal Information Institute](https://www.law.cornell.edu/regulations/pennsylvania/49-Pa-Code-SS-35-336#:~:text=,deposit%20funds)). Had I known [Agent] was simultaneously acting as an HOA official with a financial interest in my delinquency, I would never have agreed to be represented by him. His failure to disclose this dual role is a breach of the fiduciary duty of loyalty and a violation of 49 Pa. Code §35.331(a)(6) ([49 Pa. Code § 35.331 - Written agreements generally | State Regulations | US Law | LII / Legal Information Institute](https://www.law.cornell.edu/regulations/pennsylvania/49-Pa-Code-SS-35-331#:~:text=,time%20any%20conflict%20of%20interest)). It also violates the REALTOR® Code of Ethics Article 5, which prohibits providing professional services where the agent has an undisclosed personal interest ([2025 Code of Ethics & Standards of Practice](https://www.nar.realtor/about-nar/governing-documents/code-of-ethics/2025-code-of-ethics-standards-of-practice#:~:text=Article%205)).”* By referencing these authorities, the seller shows the broker that this isn’t just a personal gripe – it’s backed by law and ethics. Keep the tone professional: stick to “this is what happened” and “this is why it’s improper.”
2. **Misrepresentation of Contract Renewal as Price Reduction:** Describe the circumstances of the listing agreement’s renewal. For example: *“On [date], [Agent] presented me with a document to sign, which he described as a simple price reduction amendment. I was led to believe I was only adjusting the listing price. Only later did I realize that this form **also** extended the listing term by six months (from [original end date] to [new end date]) – a fact that was never clearly communicated to me at the time of signing.”* If the seller has a copy of the amendment, they should attach it or quote the relevant fine print. Emphasize that the agent did not highlight the extension or use plain language to explain it, depriving the seller of informed consent. Again, back this up with legal citations: “This omission and misrepresentation are tantamount to fraud. Under 63 P.S. §455.604(a)(1)-(2), it is illegal for a licensee to make a substantial misrepresentation or false promise to induce someone to enter a contract ([Section 455.604 - Prohibited acts, 63 Pa. Stat. § 455.604 | Casetext Search + Citator](https://casetext.com/statute/pennsylvania-statutes/statutes-unconsolidated/title-63-ps-professions-and-occupations-state-licensed/chapter-13a-real-estate-licensing-and-registration-act/chapter-6-duties-of-licensees/section-455604-prohibited-acts#:~:text=registrant%2C%20in%20performing%20or%20attempting,or%20organization%2C%20of%20which%20the)). Representing a six-month extension as merely a price change is a **deceptive practice**, in likely violation of Pennsylvania’s consumer protection law (73 P.S. §201-2(4)(xxi)) which forbids *‘fraudulent or deceptive conduct’* creating confusion ([Pennsylvania Businesses Are Strictly Liable for Violations of Pennsylvania’s Unfair Trade Practices and Consumer Protection Law, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court Holds - Klehr Harrison Harvey Branzburg LLP](https://klehr.com/publications/pennsylvania-businesses-are-strictly-liable-for-violations-of-pennsylvanias-unfair-trade-practices-and-consumer-protection-law-the-pennsylvania-supreme-court-holds/#:~:text=Pennsylvania%27s%20Unfair%20Trade%20Practices%20and,2%284%29%28xxi)). The NAR Code of Ethics also requires that all agreements and changes be in  *with all terms spelled out ([2025 Code of Ethics & Standards of Practice](https://www.nar.realtor/about-nar/governing-documents/code-of-ethics/2025-code-of-ethics-standards-of-practice#:~:text=Article%209)), a standard that was blatantly not met here.”* By detailing this, the seller demonstrates the renewal was not validly agreed upon. Conclude this section with the seller’s stance: *“I did not knowingly agree to extend the listing. [Agent]’s method of securing my signature was underhanded and voids my consent. Therefore, I consider the purported renewal to be null and void due to misrepresentation.”*

**D. Emphasize the Harm/Risk to the Seller:** After listing the two issues, the seller should state how these breaches affect them. For instance: *“These breaches of duty have destroyed my trust in [Agent] and [Brokerage]. I no longer feel that my interests are being protected. In fact, I feel I have been actively misled. I cannot, in good conscience, allow this agent or firm to continue representing me in the sale of my home.”* If applicable, note any specific negative impact (e.g., *“Due to these issues, I have lost valuable marketing time and confidence in the sales process”* or *“I am now concerned that the HOA conflict could interfere with potential sales or negotiations, since the agent might prioritize the HOA’s interest in recovering fees over my interest as the seller.”*). While actual damages need not be detailed for the purpose of termination, showing that the seller has been placed in a disadvantaged position helps justify why immediate termination is not only warranted by law but also necessary practically.

**E. Cite Legal Rights to Terminate:** Clearly assert that because of the above facts, the seller has the **legal right to terminate** the contract. The letter can include a paragraph such as: *“In light of the foregoing, [Agent] and [Brokerage] have materially breached our listing agreement and violated their fiduciary and statutory duties. Under Pennsylvania law, when an agent breaches their duty or a contract is induced by fraud, the client is entitled to consider the agreement void. I hereby exercise my right to rescind and terminate the listing agreement effective immediately.”* To reinforce this, one might add: *“Pennsylvania courts have ruled that an undisclosed conflict of interest by a broker or any fraudulent inducement in a real estate contract justifies the principal in immediately voiding the agreement ([Onorato v. Wissahickon Park, Inc., 430 Pa. 416 | Casetext Search + Citator](https://casetext.com/case/onorato-v-wissahickon-park-inc#:~:text=basis%20of%20the%20action%20is,agents%20profited%20from%20such%20acts)) ([What is fraudulent misrepresentation? | Very Law](https://www.verylaw.com/blog/what-is-fraudulent-misrepresentation/#:~:text=Fraudulent%20Misrepresentation%20in%20Contract%20Law)). I am invoking these rights.”* Using the terms “rescind” and “terminate for cause” indicates this is not a voluntary cancellation *on the seller’s whim*, but a *consequence of the broker’s breach*. This helps protect the seller from any claim for early termination penalties – because the termination is a result of the broker’s own violations.

**F. Demand Confirmation of Release (No Holdover, No Commission):** The letter should then specifically *demand what the seller expects the broker to do*. Typically: *“I demand that you acknowledge this termination in writing and release me from the listing agreement **without any penalty or claim of commission**, effective [date of letter].”* In addition, explicitly reference the holdover (protection) clause: *“For avoidance of doubt, no ‘tail’ or holdover provision shall apply, as the contract is void. You are not entitled to any commission or compensation, now or in the future, arising from the listing or sale of my property. Please confirm that [Brokerage] and [Agent] will not interfere with my efforts to sell the property going forward and will not claim any fee once this agreement is terminated.”* This point is crucial – it puts the broker on notice not to later argue that a buyer introduced during the listing (or any sale soon after) triggers a commission. Since the seller is asserting the contract is invalidated by breach, the holdover clause (which is part of that contract) is likewise null. The broker’s written release should ideally state that the listing is terminated by mutual agreement and that the broker waives any future claims to commission. *Note:* It may be strategic to attach a simple termination and release form for the broker to sign and return, to expedite the process. In Pennsylvania, many brokers have an “agency termination” form or one can be drafted stating the parties agree to end the listing as of a certain date, no further obligations. Encouraging a quick, clean signature on such a form will seal the deal.

**G. Set a Short Deadline and Mention Next Steps:** The letter should request a timely response – for example, *“Please provide written confirmation of the termination by [5 business days from now].”* Then add: *“If I do not receive confirmation by that date, I will understand that you have chosen not to cooperate, and I will proceed to file formal complaints with the Pennsylvania Real Estate Commission, the Realtors Association, and the Bureau of Consumer Protection, as well as consider legal action to enforce my rights.”* This line is polite but firm. It gives the broker a window to resolve the matter quietly. It also clearly states the seller’s intended next steps, which, as discussed in section 4, are entirely within the seller’s rights and can have serious consequences for the broker. By listing the specific bodies (Real Estate Commission, etc.), the seller shows they know where to go – which signals that this is a well-researched position. The broker, recognizing the severity of those potential complaints (e.g., losing one’s license or reputation), will have a strong incentive to meet the deadline and acquiesce.

**H. Professional Tone and Avoiding Legal Pitfalls:** Throughout the letter, the tone should remain **professional, factual, and assertive**. The seller should avoid personal attacks, emotional language, or idle threats. Stick to statements like *“Agent X failed to do Y, which violates law Z”* rather than *“Agent X is a liar and cheated me.”* The former is objective and persuasive; the latter could diminish the letter’s credibility or come off as hostile. The seller is effectively positioning themselves as a knowledgeable and determined consumer who is simply enforcing their rights. It often helps to use neutral language like “undisclosed conflict” and “misrepresentation” – these carry legal weight without sounding inflammatory. By citing the Code of Ethics and statutes, the seller’s letter reads as reasoned and backed by authority, which is exactly what will get the broker’s attention. Also, ensure the letter is **well-organized** – possibly using headings or bullet points (much like this outline) to make it easy for the brokerage’s management or legal department to review the issues quickly. Busy brokers will respond better to a clear presentation of facts and demands than to a rambling narrative.

**I. Leverage Any Precedents or Prior Communications:** If there were any email or text communications where the agent downplayed the renewal or if the seller already raised concerns (and the agent’s responses were telling), those can be referenced or attached. Additionally, citing any known cases or disciplinary actions (if the seller has that information) can reinforce the point. For instance: *“I am aware that in **Aiello v. Ed Saxe Real Estate, Inc.**, 508 Pa. 553 (1985), the Pennsylvania Supreme Court held a broker accountable for an agent’s fraudulent misrepresentations to clients ( [Aiello v. Ed Saxe Real Estate, Inc. :: 1985 :: Supreme Court of Pennsylvania Decisions :: Pennsylvania Case Law :: Pennsylvania Law :: U.S. Law :: Justia](https://law.justia.com/cases/pennsylvania/supreme-court/1985/508-pa-553-1.html#:~:text=Appellants%2C%20thereupon%2C%20filed%20a%20trespass,jury%20that%20it%20could%20find)) ( [Aiello v. Ed Saxe Real Estate, Inc. :: 1985 :: Supreme Court of Pennsylvania Decisions :: Pennsylvania Case Law :: Pennsylvania Law :: U.S. Law :: Justia](https://law.justia.com/cases/pennsylvania/supreme-court/1985/508-pa-553-1.html#:~:text=Jones%20may%20have%20made%20to,Appellants)). My situation is analogous – [Agent]’s misrepresentations and conflicts are attributable to [Brokerage], and I expect the firm to take responsibility and release me from this tainted contract.”* While the broker will likely not want to debate case law, including a court precedent shows that the seller is prepared to back up their claims legally if needed. Even mentioning *Onorato* or the general rule that *“dual representation without consent is voidable”* ([Onorato v. Wissahickon Park, Inc., 430 Pa. 416 | Casetext Search + Citator](https://casetext.com/case/onorato-v-wissahickon-park-inc#:~:text=5,423)) can be powerful.

**J. Close the Letter Formally:** End with a courteous but firm closing. For example: *“I trust you understand the seriousness of these issues and will promptly do the right thing. I look forward to your confirmation that the listing agreement is terminated. Thank you for your immediate attention to this matter.”* Sign and date the letter, and keep a copy. It should be sent via a method that provides proof of delivery – certified mail, email (with a read receipt or confirmation), or even hand delivery to the broker’s office with a signed acknowledgment. This documentation might be needed as evidence if, for any reason, the dispute escalates.

By following this strategic approach, the seller creates a well-supported case file that any reasonable broker will recognize as more than sufficient grounds to cancel the listing. The combination of specific factual allegations and authoritative legal citations demonstrates that the seller can likely prove **“cause”** for termination. Brokerages, when faced with a client letter citing chapter and verse of the law, will understand that fighting to enforce the listing (or to claim a commission later) would be futile and potentially damaging to themselves. Thus, the likely outcome is that the broker will agree in writing to terminate the agreement immediately and without penalty. This allows the seller to walk away cleanly – able to hire a new agent or sell by owner – with no lingering liability. Importantly, the seller would have minimized their risk by *not* simply walking away or violating the contract, but rather by building a strong case for termination. In summary, the seller’s goal is achieved: exit the contract **now**, on fair terms, by firmly standing on legal and ethical rights. The structured demand, backed by Pennsylvania law ([Section 455.604 - Prohibited acts, 63 Pa.

I will carefully analyze the Pennsylvania Consumer Notice to determine whether it includes any provisions that might protect the Realtor from a conflict of interest claim. If there is nothing in the notice that weakens your position, I will confirm that for you. I will then continue researching Pennsylvania real estate law, statutes, and professional regulations to establish whether a conflict of interest—specifically the Realtor’s undisclosed HOA board membership—provides a legally sound basis for terminating your listing agreement before its expiration.

I will update you once I have completed the review.

Conflict of Interest Analysis for Listing Agreement Termination

# Pennsylvania Consumer Notice and Conflict of Interest

**Consumer Notice Requirements:** Pennsylvania’s required *Consumer Notice* is a disclosure form given to sellers and buyers at the start of an agency relationship. It outlines the types of agency relationships and the duties owed by real estate licensees under state law (the Real Estate Licensing and Registration Act, or “RELRA”). One of the explicit duties it lists is the duty to disclose any conflicts of interest to the client _“as soon as practicable”_​[pa.gov](https://www.pa.gov/content/dam/copapwp-pagov/en/dos/department-and-offices/bpoa/real-estate/Written%20Consumer%20Notice.pdf#:~:text=%E2%80%A2%20Disclose%2C%20as%20soon%20as,and%20advise%20the%20consumer%20regarding). In other words, the agent must promptly inform the consumer if the agent has a personal interest or conflict that could interfere with putting the client’s interests first​[pa.gov](https://www.pa.gov/content/dam/copapwp-pagov/en/dos/department-and-offices/bpoa/real-estate/Written%20Consumer%20Notice.pdf#:~:text=%E2%80%A2%20Disclose%2C%20as%20soon%20as,and%20advise%20the%20consumer%20regarding). This notice is **not** a contract itself but a state-mandated disclosure meant to educate consumers on broker duties.

**No Protection for Undisclosed Conflicts:** Nowhere does the Consumer Notice state that an undisclosed conflict of interest is acceptable or shielded from consequences. In fact, the opposite is true – it emphasizes the agent’s obligation to **disclose** conflicts, reinforcing that hiding such a conflict would violate the agent’s duties. There is no clause in the notice suggesting that a conflict like the Realtor being on the HOA board is “permissible” or that it would *not* be grounds for terminating the agency. The notice doesn’t provide any safe harbor for the agent; it simply warns the consumer that licensees owe duties of loyalty and disclosure. For example, Pennsylvania’s regulations require that all written listing agreements remind the client of the _“licensee’s continuing duty to disclose […] any conflict of interest”_​[casetext.com](https://casetext.com/regulation/pennsylvania-code-rules-and-regulations/title-49-professional-and-vocational-standards/part-i-department-of-state/subpart-a-professional-and-occupational-affairs/chapter-35-state-real-estate-commission/subchapter-e-standards-of-conduct-and-practice/real-estate-documents/section-35331-written-agreements-generally#:~:text=possibility%20that%20the%20broker%20or,any%20potential%20for%20the%20broker). The standard **exclusive listing contract** itself usually defines a conflict of interest as any situation in which the broker or their agent has a personal interest in the property or *“cannot put the Seller’s interests before any other,”* and it requires the broker to notify the seller immediately if such a conflict arises​[dlalexander.com](https://dlalexander.com/forms/ListingContract-ExclusiveRighttoSellRealEstate.pdf#:~:text=It%20is%20a%20conflict%20of,signed%20by%20Broker%20and%20Seller). In short, neither the Consumer Notice nor the listing agreement excuses an agent’s undisclosed conflict – rather, the expectation is that any potential conflict (like being an HOA board member overseeing the property’s community) **must** be disclosed to the seller. Failing to do so would breach the agent’s obligations under both the notice and the contract.

# Fiduciary Duty and Conflicts – Legal Framework

**Duty to Disclose Conflicts (PA Law):** Pennsylvania real estate law imposes a fiduciary duty of loyalty on brokers and agents, meaning the agent must act in the client’s best interest at all times. A core part of that duty is avoiding conflicts of interest or, at minimum, disclosing them fully. State regulations explicitly state: _“A licensee has a continuing obligation to disclose to a principal any conflict of interest in a reasonably practicable period of time after the licensee learns or should have learned of the conflict”_​[casetext.com](https://casetext.com/regulation/pennsylvania-code-rules-and-regulations/title-49-professional-and-vocational-standards/part-i-department-of-state/subpart-a-professional-and-occupational-affairs/chapter-35-state-real-estate-commission/subchapter-e-standards-of-conduct-and-practice/general-ethical-responsibilities/section-35283-disclosure-of-interest#:~:text=the%20consumer%20will%20be%20using,of%20the%20conflict%20of%20interest). This legal requirement echoes what’s in the Consumer Notice. It means if the agent discovers a conflict (for example, realizing that their role as an HOA board member might conflict with the seller’s interests), they are legally bound to inform the seller promptly. Pennsylvania’s real estate commission regulations even mandate that every brokerage contract include a notice of this ongoing duty to disclose conflicts​[casetext.com](https://casetext.com/regulation/pennsylvania-code-rules-and-regulations/title-49-professional-and-vocational-standards/part-i-department-of-state/subpart-a-professional-and-occupational-affairs/chapter-35-state-real-estate-commission/subchapter-e-standards-of-conduct-and-practice/real-estate-documents/section-35331-written-agreements-generally#:~:text=possibility%20that%20the%20broker%20or,any%20potential%20for%20the%20broker). An agent who fails to disclose a known conflict is violating these regulations and RELRA’s standards of conduct. In practical terms, hiding a significant conflict of interest would be a form of misrepresentation or breach of loyalty, which can subject the agent to disciplinary action by the State Real Estate Commission (and certainly erode the client’s trust).

**Realtor Code of Ethics:** In addition to state law, the National Association of Realtors (NAR) Code of Ethics holds Realtors to a high standard regarding conflicts of interest. **Article 1** of the Code requires Realtors to protect their client’s interests above all else, and **Article 5** specifically provides that Realtors *“shall not undertake to provide professional services concerning a property or its value where they have a present or contemplated interest”* in that property without disclosing that interest to all parties​[bartosgroup.com](https://bartosgroup.com/code-of-ethics/#:~:text=Code%20Of%20Ethics%20,contemplated%20interest%20unless%20such). In plainer terms, if a Realtor has any personal stake or role that might affect the transaction, it must be disclosed. While being an HOA board member isn’t an ownership interest in the *property* itself, it is a position that could influence or conflict with the client’s interests (since HOA boards can impose rules or make decisions affecting the property and community). The spirit of the Code would treat that scenario as a potential conflict requiring disclosure to the seller. The Realtor’s fiduciary duty of loyalty means they should **“act at all times solely in the best interests of [the] principal to the exclusion of all other interests,”** and to _“avoid steadfastly any conflicts of interest that might compromise or dilute the broker’s undivided loyalty”_​[nar.realtor](https://www.nar.realtor/sites/default/files/handouts-and-brochures/2014/nar-fiduciary-duty-032213.pdf#:~:text=obligates%20a%20real%20estate%20broker,or%20are%20adverse%20to%2C%20his). An HOA board membership certainly qualifies as an “other interest” that could dilute loyalty, so the ethical course is full disclosure (and possibly recusal from either the board’s decisions or the representation if the conflict is too severe). Failure to disclose such a conflict would violate the NAR Code of Ethics and undermine the fiduciary relationship.

**Bottom Line – No Explicit Exemption:** To directly answer the first part of the question: The Pennsylvania Consumer Notice does **not** contain any provision that protects the Realtor in the event of an undisclosed conflict of interest. It doesn’t say an undisclosed conflict is permissible or absolved. On the contrary, both the notice and applicable laws stress that **all conflicts must be disclosed** to the client​[pa.gov](https://www.pa.gov/content/dam/copapwp-pagov/en/dos/department-and-offices/bpoa/real-estate/Written%20Consumer%20Notice.pdf#:~:text=%E2%80%A2%20Disclose%2C%20as%20soon%20as,and%20advise%20the%20consumer%20regarding)​[casetext.com](https://casetext.com/regulation/pennsylvania-code-rules-and-regulations/title-49-professional-and-vocational-standards/part-i-department-of-state/subpart-a-professional-and-occupational-affairs/chapter-35-state-real-estate-commission/subchapter-e-standards-of-conduct-and-practice/general-ethical-responsibilities/section-35283-disclosure-of-interest#:~:text=the%20consumer%20will%20be%20using,of%20the%20conflict%20of%20interest). There is no language suggesting that a conflict of interest like being an HOA board member is immune from consequences or that it wouldn’t be grounds to end the agency relationship. In fact, an agent concealing such a conflict would be violating the duties outlined to the consumer.

# Terminating a Listing Agreement for Conflict of Interest

Given that an undisclosed conflict of interest breaches the agent’s fiduciary obligations, the next issue is whether the seller has the right to terminate an active listing agreement before it expires on that basis. The short answer is **yes** – a serious, undisclosed conflict of interest can be legal grounds for a seller to terminate the agency relationship (and the listing contract) early, due to the agent’s breach of their fiduciary duty of loyalty.

**Principal’s Right to End the Agency:** Under general agency law (which Pennsylvania follows), a principal (the seller) always has the power to revoke or withdraw the agent’s authority – in other words, you can fire your agent at any time. However, if there is a contract (like an exclusive listing agreement) for a set term, terminating it without a valid reason could potentially be a breach of that contract, making the seller liable for damages or the agent’s commission. The key distinction is **cause**: if the agent’s own misconduct or breach of duty gives rise to the termination, then the seller’s termination is legally justified and would *not* be considered a wrongful breach by the seller​[law.justia.com](https://law.justia.com/cases/pennsylvania/supreme-court/1987/368-pa-super-557-0.html#:~:text=terminated%20by%20an%20employer%20prior,of%20Agency%20%C2%A7%20450)​[parealtors.org](https://www.parealtors.org/blog/terminating-an-agreement-of-sale/#:~:text=A%20breach%20of%20the%20agreement,client%20first%20consult%20legal%20counsel). Pennsylvania courts recognize that while you *can* always end an agency relationship, doing so “in violation of the contract” can lead to liability – but a **material breach by the agent** (such as violating a fiduciary duty) excuses the principal from the contract​[law.justia.com](https://law.justia.com/cases/pennsylvania/supreme-court/1987/368-pa-super-557-0.html#:~:text=terminated%20by%20an%20employer%20prior,of%20Agency%20%C2%A7%20450). In contract law terms, the agent’s breach can give the principal the right to *rescind or terminate* the agreement for cause​[parealtors.org](https://www.parealtors.org/blog/terminating-an-agreement-of-sale/#:~:text=A%20breach%20of%20the%20agreement,client%20first%20consult%20legal%20counsel).

**Undisclosed Conflict = Breach of Duty:** If a Realtor was an HOA board member and failed to tell the seller, that omission is likely a breach of the duty of loyalty (and a violation of state law as discussed). The agent has put themselves in a position where their obligations to the HOA could conflict with duties to the client, all without the client’s knowledge. This kind of undisclosed conflict **strikes at the heart of the fiduciary relationship**. Courts have held that fiduciaries who hide conflicts of interest are in breach of their duty, sometimes leading to remedies like disgorgement of any fees/commission earned as a result of the disloyalty​[davegooden.com](https://davegooden.com/2024/10/cancelling-listing-agreement/#:~:text=In%20the%20case%20of%20unethical,often%20the%20most%20amicable%20solution). At the very least, the seller would have a strong argument that the agent’s breach relieved the seller of any further obligations under the listing contract. The Pennsylvania Association of Realtors’ legal guidance notes that *“a breach of the agreement by one party may justify termination by the other”* even if the contract doesn’t spell it out​[parealtors.org](https://www.parealtors.org/blog/terminating-an-agreement-of-sale/#:~:text=A%20breach%20of%20the%20agreement,client%20first%20consult%20legal%20counsel). Here, the “agreement” breached is not only the written listing contract (which, by law, included the duty to disclose conflicts​[casetext.com](https://casetext.com/regulation/pennsylvania-code-rules-and-regulations/title-49-professional-and-vocational-standards/part-i-department-of-state/subpart-a-professional-and-occupational-affairs/chapter-35-state-real-estate-commission/subchapter-e-standards-of-conduct-and-practice/real-estate-documents/section-35331-written-agreements-generally#:~:text=possibility%20that%20the%20broker%20or,any%20potential%20for%20the%20broker)), but also the fundamental fiduciary agreement of trust.

**Industry Practice and Remedies:** In real-world practice, when a seller discovers that their agent has a serious conflict of interest that wasn’t disclosed, the situation often leads to an early termination of the listing. The seller can and should raise the issue with the broker (the agent’s supervising broker) and request to cancel the listing for cause. Many brokers, when faced with clear evidence of their agent’s conflict or misconduct, will agree to terminate the listing agreement rather than risk an ethics complaint or legal dispute. In fact, professional advice to brokers is that if a client is justifiably unhappy due to an agent’s unethical behavior, the broker should release them from the contract to avoid liability​[davegooden.com](https://davegooden.com/2024/10/cancelling-listing-agreement/#:~:text=In%20the%20case%20of%20unethical,often%20the%20most%20amicable%20solution)​[upnest.com](https://www.upnest.com/1/post/illegal-real-estate-practices/#:~:text=If%20you%E2%80%99re%20not%20satisfied%20with,early%20without%20incurring%20any%20fees). The Pennsylvania Realtors association has given examples that **unethical behavior or a fiduciary breach by the agent gives the seller “a stronger case for terminating the agreement without penalty.”**​[davegooden.com](https://davegooden.com/2024/10/cancelling-listing-agreement/#:~:text=In%20the%20case%20of%20unethical,often%20the%20most%20amicable%20solution) In such cases, the broker might offer to assign a different agent or simply do a mutual release of the listing agreement. A mutual release is essentially both parties agreeing to end the contract early with no further obligations. This is often the cleanest solution.

Legally, if the agent vehemently refused to release the seller, the seller could stand on the argument that the agent’s breach (the undisclosed conflict) voids the contract. The seller’s right to *unilaterally* terminate for cause is supported by the fiduciary nature of the relationship – an agency coupled with a breach of trust is not one a court would force the seller to continue. Notably, one remedy in fiduciary law is that an agent who breaches loyalty may **forfeit their right to compensation** during the period of disloyalty. In other words, a Realtor who secretly acted with a conflict of interest could be denied any commission if the relationship is severed over that breach. This aligns with the idea that the seller should not suffer a penalty (like paying a fee) for firing an agent who wasn’t living up to their end of the deal.

**Supporting Regulations and Case Law:** While Pennsylvania’s statutes don’t have a section that explicitly says “a client may terminate a listing if the agent has a conflict,” the combination of fiduciary duty principles and the state’s real estate regulations strongly support the seller’s right to do so. For instance, the state regulation requiring conflict disclosure (49 Pa. Code § 35.283) inherently assumes that an undisclosed conflict is unacceptable​[casetext.com](https://casetext.com/regulation/pennsylvania-code-rules-and-regulations/title-49-professional-and-vocational-standards/part-i-department-of-state/subpart-a-professional-and-occupational-affairs/chapter-35-state-real-estate-commission/subchapter-e-standards-of-conduct-and-practice/general-ethical-responsibilities/section-35283-disclosure-of-interest#:~:text=the%20consumer%20will%20be%20using,of%20the%20conflict%20of%20interest). If an agent violates that, it’s a breach of the law governing their license. The Real Estate Commission could discipline the agent for it, and a court would likely view the undisclosed conflict as a form of misrepresentation or breach of contract. Additionally, general contract law (common law) in Pennsylvania holds that a **material breach** by one party allows the other party to terminate the contract. The PAR legal counsel has cautioned that exercising termination for breach can be “fact dependent”​[parealtors.org](https://www.parealtors.org/blog/terminating-an-agreement-of-sale/#:~:text=result%20of%20another%E2%80%99s%20breach%20is,client%20first%20consult%20legal%20counsel) – meaning one should be sure the breach is significant – but an undisclosed fiduciary conflict would typically qualify as significant.

It’s worth noting that, separate from contract termination, the seller could also file an ethics complaint with the local Realtor board for violation of the NAR Code of Ethics, and/or a complaint with the Pennsylvania State Real Estate Commission for violation of license law, due to the agent’s undisclosed conflict. Those avenues could result in professional discipline for the agent (fines, suspension, etc.), although they don’t directly cancel the listing. However, the existence of those enforcement mechanisms further underscores that the law views undisclosed conflicts very seriously – certainly serious enough to justify ending the agency relationship.

# Conclusion

**No Clause in Notice Preventing Termination:** The Pennsylvania Consumer Notice does not give the Realtor any protection against a conflict of interest claim – quite the opposite, it mandates disclosure of conflicts, and nowhere implies that an undisclosed conflict is acceptable or not grounds for firing the agent. An agent’s role as an HOA board member, if not disclosed to a seller, would violate the duties outlined in that notice and in Pennsylvania’s real estate regulations.

**Right to Terminate for Cause:** Under Pennsylvania law and the Realtor Code of Ethics, an agent’s undisclosed conflict of interest is a breach of their fiduciary duty of loyalty. Such a breach **is valid legal grounds** for a seller to terminate an active listing agreement before expiration. Statutes and regulations require loyalty and full disclosure from the agent​[casetext.com](https://casetext.com/regulation/pennsylvania-code-rules-and-regulations/title-49-professional-and-vocational-standards/part-i-department-of-state/subpart-a-professional-and-occupational-affairs/chapter-35-state-real-estate-commission/subchapter-e-standards-of-conduct-and-practice/general-ethical-responsibilities/section-35283-disclosure-of-interest#:~:text=the%20consumer%20will%20be%20using,of%20the%20conflict%20of%20interest)​[casetext.com](https://casetext.com/regulation/pennsylvania-code-rules-and-regulations/title-49-professional-and-vocational-standards/part-i-department-of-state/subpart-a-professional-and-occupational-affairs/chapter-35-state-real-estate-commission/subchapter-e-standards-of-conduct-and-practice/real-estate-documents/section-35331-written-agreements-generally#:~:text=possibility%20that%20the%20broker%20or,any%20potential%20for%20the%20broker), and an agent who fails in that regard cannot hold the seller hostage to the contract. Pennsylvania real estate authorities and case law recognize that a principal may end the agency relationship if the agent’s actions undermine the very purpose of the agency​[law.justia.com](https://law.justia.com/cases/pennsylvania/supreme-court/1987/368-pa-super-557-0.html#:~:text=terminated%20by%20an%20employer%20prior,of%20Agency%20%C2%A7%20450)​[parealtors.org](https://www.parealtors.org/blog/terminating-an-agreement-of-sale/#:~:text=A%20breach%20of%20the%20agreement,client%20first%20consult%20legal%20counsel). In practice, sellers who discover a conflict of interest have the right to fire their agent, and they should not be penalized for doing so when the agent was the one in breach​[davegooden.com](https://davegooden.com/2024/10/cancelling-listing-agreement/#:~:text=In%20the%20case%20of%20unethical,often%20the%20most%20amicable%20solution). In summary, nothing in the Consumer Notice insulates the Realtor from a conflict of interest allegation, and both legal principles and ethical rules support the seller’s right to terminate the listing early due to the agent’s conflicting fiduciary obligations.

### Analysis of the Delinquency Update #### Evidence from the Document - **Agenda Item**: The March 5, 2025, meeting agenda includes "Finances" with sub-items "2024 Year End Report" and "Delinquency Update (March 2025 Status)." This suggests the delinquency update is part of the financial overview, likely prepared by Chancellor Properties Inc. (managed by Karen Oglesby) for the HOA board and owners. - **Context**: The meeting occurred the day before Karen’s March 6, 2025, email demanding $3,187.72 for your unit 4C, indicating the update may relate to current delinquency statuses, including yours. - **Attendance**: Described as a Zoom meeting, it implies open access to all unit owners, though participation levels vary. The election of Juliana Martell (Unit #5A) as a nominee suggests board members, including her, were actively involved. #### Likely Nature of the Delinquency Update 1. **General Overview vs. Unit-Specific Details**: - **General Overview**: HOA annual meetings typically provide a broad financial report, including total delinquent dues, trends, and actions planned (e.g., collection or legal steps). This protects owner privacy by avoiding individual identification, aligning with standard practices unless specific authorization exists. - **Unit-Specific Details**: Disclosing individual delinquencies (e.g., your $3,187.72 debt) would be unusual unless the governing documents or state law permit it, and only with notice to affected owners. Pennsylvania’s Uniform Planned Community Act (68 Pa. C.S. § 5312) allows HOAs to discuss financial matters but does not mandate public shaming of delinquents unless part of a formal enforcement action (e.g., lien filing). 2. **Community Call-In/Attendance**: - **Privacy Concern**: You’re correct that it would be strange and potentially invasive for an entire community to hear about neighbors’ financial difficulties during a general meeting. This could violate privacy expectations and, in some cases, fair housing laws if it leads to discrimination or harassment. - **HOA Practice**: Most HOAs limit delinquency discussions to board executive sessions or written notices to affected owners, as seen with Karen’s direct emails to you (February 13 and March 6, 2025). Public disclosure is rare unless a unit’s delinquency impacts the association’s financial health significantly (e.g., triggering a special assessment). 3. **Financial Investment Rationale**: - **Right to Know**: Owners have a vested interest in the HOA’s financial stability, as delinquencies can affect reserve funds, maintenance, or assessments. Pennsylvania law (68 Pa. C.S. § 5302) requires transparency in financial reporting, but this is typically aggregated data, not individual accounts. - **Balance with Privacy**: The HOA’s governing documents (e.g., bylaws, declaration) likely outline confidentiality rules. Without seeing these, it’s reasonable to assume they prohibit public naming of delinquents unless part of a legal process (e.g., lien or foreclosure notice under 68 Pa. C.S. § 5315). #### Reasonable Assumption - **Most Likely Scenario**: The "Delinquency Update (March 2025 Status)" was a general overview presented to owners, reporting the total amount of delinquent dues, the number of affected units, and planned actions (e.g., collection efforts), without divulging specific unit numbers or owners’ names. This is standard to maintain privacy while informing the community of financial health. - **Juliana’s Knowledge**: As a board member and nominee (per the February 4, 2025, nomination form), Juliana likely received detailed delinquency reports from Chancellor Properties Inc. prior to or during the meeting. Karen’s emails to you suggest she (and thus the board) had specific knowledge of your $3,187.72 debt, especially given the timing (March 5 meeting, March 6 email). This indicates Juliana knew of your delinquency, even if not publicly disclosed. - **Community Awareness**: It’s unlikely the full community (via Zoom) was informed of your specific debt unless the agenda or bylaws explicitly allowed it, which seems improbable given privacy norms. However, board members, including Juliana, would have access to this information, creating her conflict. #### Supporting Research - **Pennsylvania HOA Laws**: The Uniform Planned Community Act (68 Pa. C.S. § 5303) requires annual financial statements but does not mandate public disclosure of individual delinquencies. Section 5312 allows boards to enforce payment but suggests private notice before public action. - **NAR Code of Ethics**: Article 1 requires agents to protect and promote clients’ interests, and undisclosed knowledge of financial issues (e.g., your debt) could breach this if it affects representation. - **HOA Best Practices**: Resources like [HOAleader.com](https://www.hoaleader.com) and [Cedar Management Group](https://www.cedarmanagementgroup.com) recommend limiting delinquency discussions to executive sessions or written notices to preserve confidentiality, supporting the general overview assumption. ### Implications for Your Case - **Juliana’s Conflict**: Whether the update was general or specific, Juliana’s board role gave her access to your delinquency details (corroborated by Karen’s emails). This knowledge, undisclosed in the listing agreement (Paragraph 22), supports your termination argument, as it could influence her pricing ($433,000 reduction) or negotiation strategy. - **Community Privacy**: The unlikelihood of public disclosure alleviates your concern about neighbors knowing, but it doesn’t negate Juliana’s obligation to disclose her dual role and debt awareness to you as her client. - **Strategy Validation**: The assumption of a general update strengthens your case by focusing the conflict on Juliana’s private knowledge, not community exposure, aligning with fiduciary duty breaches under Pennsylvania law.
