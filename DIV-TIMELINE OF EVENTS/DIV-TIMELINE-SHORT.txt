Updated Addendum: Expanded Legal and Financial Implications Including Disability and Employment non-Concealment

This supplemental section integrates additional key facts into the original analysis provided in the "Financial Disclosure Analysis by Stephen Boerner" and should be inserted into the following sections:

Section: Timeline of Key Events – Insert After December 2024

• December 2024 (Expanded Context): Melissa begins full-time employment at the Hospital of Pennsylvania. She failed to initially disclose this new employment in her December 2024 financial disclosures despite being legally obligated to under PA Rule 1920.33. This omission directly impacted her husband's ability to seek appropriate temporary financial relief, such as Alimony Pendente Lite (APL). I need to confirm it was initially undisclosed or if Melissa provided this information only after integogation regarding disclosure timing of employment that commenced in December 2024, but did she only disclosed when required to by stephen boerner's council ? and did she not disclose healthcare afforded to her nor offer to extend healthcare for spouse that would have provided six months of healthcare to disabled husband as of the time of this writing May 29, 2025 with melissa's employment beginning full-time in early December 2024.

• December 2024–March 2025: Melissa has employer-sponsored health benefits available through her job but does not offer to add her husband to her plan, despite the fact that they are still legally married and he is unemployed, disabled, and actively seeking Social Security Disability (SSDI). Her failure to provide or contribute to health coverage may be considered a violation of spousal support expectations.

Section: Financial Analysis > Potential Disclosure Issues – Expanded

Add the following points:

Melissa's failure to disclose her December 2024 employment with the Hospital of Pennsylvania represents a material omission. This income should have been part of her financial affidavit and its absence may constitute discovery misconduct or bad faith.

The account closure immediately preceding her new job start date raises suspicion that funds and new income were deliberately shielded from marital accounting.

The Husband's disability and unemployment underscore the legal inequity created by this nondisclosure.

Section: Alimony Considerations – Expanded

Husband is not only unemployed, but has also been diagnosed with PTSD and ADHD as a result of a violent home invasion in March 2024. This has rendered him unable to work since that date. These health conditions are clinically documented and supported by a pending Social Security Disability claim.

Melissa’s failure to provide access to medical insurance during this period may be construed by the court as abandonment of her financial duty to a dependent spouse.

Her full-time employment, combined with her income and benefits, strengthens Husband’s entitlement to both APL and post-divorce alimony.

Section: Legal Implications of Melissa’s Actions – Expanded

Her choice to withhold both financial and medical support from a disabled, unemployed spouse—while actively concealing income—may be viewed as not only bad faith but also as financial coercion. This increases her potential exposure to:

Retroactive support orders

Sanctions for nondisclosure

An enhanced share of marital debt

Reduced entitlement to equity in property distribution

Pennsylvania courts, particularly in Delaware County, consider such conduct seriously and may issue a contribution order, alimony pendente lite, or even attorney fee shifting.

This addendum should be reviewed as an official supplement to the original report and used in any legal filings or court proceedings requiring a refined argument that incorporates disability, omitted employment, and post-separation non-concealment of financial resources having disclosed employment that commenced in December 2024, but only disclosed when required to by stephen boerner's council and did not disclose healthcare afforded to her nor offer to extend healthcare for spouse that would have provided six months of healthcare to disabled husband as of the time of this writing May 29, 2025 with melissa's employment beginning full-time in early December 2024.
